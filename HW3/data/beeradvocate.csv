look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.25This is likely spot-on for style, but a bit too much pucker for me. Pours a beautiful berry-red with a quick-fading cap of white. Aroma is heavenly raspberry and very mild funk. Flavors are delicious as well, with tons of berry dominating. Very tart. So tart. But, I don't review so much for style attributes, but whether I enjoy. This one took me 2 sittings.May 02, 2022"

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one, as part of the beatings he delivered during NBS BIF #15. 12.7oz Cork and Caged bottle (Packaged Dec 3 2020) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a lovely dark red color with about 1/8 inch of pink head that quickly dissipated and left no lacing.



The aroma was solidly full of raspberry, with just a light bit of grain in the background.



On the tongue, a big hit of bitterness punches the front of the palate, with raspberry dominating the rest.



The body was light, crisp, had decent carb, and a very dry finish.



Drinkability was very good, I'd like to have regular access to this.



Overall, a very good beer. A must-try if you see it.May 01, 2022"

Pours dark copper with a burgundy tinge. Quickly fizzling head with zero retention or lacing. Fairly evident raspberries in the nose with faint cider vinegar and diaper. Light bodied with a slickish, limp mouthfeel. Raspberries on the palate with a solid tartness but short of sour or jammy. Finishes with a nice balance of tart and raspberries.Apr 21, 2022"

1/2"" pink tinted head, limited retention and ends up as a partial cap and ring. No lacing. The beer is a glowing red/purple with very good clarity - beautiful color. Tart raspberry, oak, light funk, and vinous quality in the nose. Awesome tart raspberry flavor, bright, rich fruit with bracing acidity. Light body, bright entry, medium acid, all in a dry, tart fruit-filled finish. Outstanding.Jan 17, 2022"

Smell is tart and vinous with notes of fresh raspberries, raspberry jam, lime, oak and bit of funk.



Taste is phenomenal. Tart with tons of fresh raspberries and a bit of jam. Dry and vinous with notes of peach, oak, funk and a bit of bitterness. Nice acidity and tremendous balance.



Mouthfeel is medium and dry with effervescent carbonation.



Overall, a stunning beer. I am a huge fan for raspberries in beer, and this is close to the daddy, Cantillon's Rose de Gambrinus.Oct 19, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5Very interesting and complex ale. First, this is definitely a sour. I usually do not like sours but this is definitely one I will keep drinking. The nose is a very light raspberry with a hint of yeast or fruit wine influence. It is a beautiful deep red color. The taste definitely has a fruit wine influence with a subtle bubbly or spicy finish. Overall a fantastic well made beer, especially if you enjoy raspberries.Sep 01, 2021"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer was pinkish red is color with white bubble clinging to the sides of the glass. 



Smell -,The nose brought to mind vinegary red berries. 



Taste - There was a lot of raspberry in the taste, but I also detected some tart cherries. It was surrounded by a vinegary presence. The profile was tart, but did not remove tooth enamel. Sourness was lessened by a dry finish. 



Mouthfeel - The carbonation was fairly intense, allowing for a dry finish. 



Overall - This was a fine, well balanced sour.Aug 22, 2021"

Nonetheless, the preceding kick-off presents a spumescent elegance, as the stretch reaches to inches ahead of that ensuing regression. That initial onset categorizes those collared inches from Arabian Oryx to shredded coconut, before the unseating takes a painter’s knife to the pebbly brim. Just below is a presentation on appearance that succumbs the Golden Shield Lichen, with a Tuscan sun appeal. The output continues with intermittent transfers, which later transcribe hues in chartreuse, as shades of dim scarlet calmly intersect. During the walk, a growing classiness from air drafts of duration, which polish an engraving collar endowment with coupled calm clarity



S: Entryway is greeted by an involvedness preempted by esters, and a countryside funk that’s just setting off. In that regard, the indulgence stretches across citrus fruits with a ploughed rusticity that incises the herbed wheat kindly. The scents carry on towards cameo apples besides the pear drop to honey bananas, while pink & white grapefruit alloy the baboon lemon kind of limes. There’s a touch of grainy malt, for the cracker-y moments, which respect the advancing yeast properties to umbrella remote spices. In the interim, a distant dank earthiness, for fresh hay and cut pastures, while pulling a dragged mustiness out from barnyard phenols. The aerated openness channels oak to the finer points inside dry/calibrated wine, as a background frowzy lays horse blankets atop cellar moths. The forward march is neatly acidic, while continuing to press earthy must on fading rose petals, before the dry & brittle antiques of wooden leather



T: A mineralogy reading, for foretaste to indulge, with the accompanying fruit + spices relating to the harvested derives. Inferences campaign on earthy farmsteads with feedlot jazz and cultivated tobacco, as a tempered acidity roots crimson red rhubarbs. On balance, a light malt baking to field hops with a toasted spiciness, while yeast properties grind along a rural bitterness. Accordingly, grassy provinces with situated granaries that stow garnered wheat. The vintage addresses contextual funk, and pushes agricultural sulfates thru river rock mulch, as fungus builds upon the air-dry acclimations. There’s a developing cue of Grüner Veltliner, by the elongated pour for grape tinges, and a furtherance for cellar natures. To that end, a docility on acidity, as notations add oddity for woodlot ecology and slurry manure, afore dry skin briefcases



M: A bright, light buoyancy with antiquated funk, and sharp vibrancy. The allotted span comes with arbitrated tartness, which is moderated throughout, as a compliment to the progressed barrenness. Thus, a thrilling attenuation that styles effervescence handily, as the timed exposure madcaps the resounding involvedness from side to side upon the clean-complete finish 



O: An environmental showcase that harvests funk habitually, with a touch of wheat malt in back to weigh hop efficiency. The moment of service is a period of effectiveness, given the dry bite for the webbed yeast densities and age aligning land-locksDec 13, 2021"

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.752021 release. Bottle to tumbler.



Look: Jet black with with lots of tiny floaters looking like golden stardust. No head. No lacing.



Smell: Malty, sweet and boozy. Clear notes of rye, molasses and coffee.



Taste: The rye is very present with the molasses adding sweetness, the coffee bitterness. Dark chocolate is there, malty and woody hints as well. The boozy barrel notes keep everything together very nicely. 



Feel: Full and thick. Rather creamy than syrupy. Very low carbonation.



Overall: At first, the combination of rye, molasses and coffee didn't sound too promising to me as I'm not a big fan of any of the three flavors in my stouts. However, in this case every single one of them adds to a perfectly balanced taste which, together with the creamy mouthfeel, results in a fantastic beer.May 18, 2022"

4.41/5  rDev -1.6%
look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.52021 release - batch 5. 13.3% ABV. Poured from a 500mL bottle into a snifter.



Clear (?) seal brown liquid with a faint tan collar. Vague sheen of tears; no head development. 



Rich, balanced aromas of coffee, roast malt, chocolate covered cherries, faint pipe tobacco, and molasses; perhaps an earthy hop note at times. 



Unctuous palate entry suffused with all the flavors from the nose, dialed up. Bittersweet chocolate, bright stone fruit/berry notes, leading to layers of cocoa, loam, treacle, and toasted brown sugar. Malt exhibits moderate roast qualities, but more forward character comes from the coffee and barrel. No char. Low bitterness. Medium-dry finish. Decent complexity, but more focus on balance and smoothness I think.



Oily, rich, medium-full body with dangerously disguised alcohol. 



Excellent example of the style, although, perhaps, the base beer is a touch subdued. Maybe not the best value, but I won't dock any points for that...Apr 02, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Midnight black oily pour with a brown head. The nose is essentially a perfect ba coffee stout nose, and thus elevated the overall score a bit: huge and full coffee with tones of bean and grounds plus earth, bittersweet dark chocolate, rye, dried date, plus huge rich barrel notes with an emphasis on the molasses and vanillin laiden bourbon, wow. Taste has brighter complexion with semi-sweet chocolate, raisin, and barrel is not as powerful, loses the rye and some earth tones, but still excellent. Feel is chewy yet medium bodied, good barrel with the warmth in particular, but coffee is the clear star with roast and percolation for days. Overall just a little shy of being one of the greats, but the smell is thereFeb 23, 2022"

750ml corked/caged bottle served in a tulip. Bottling date 08/26/2020. Bought it earlier today at Chuck's Hop Shop Seward Park. It was expensive.



Pours a dark purplish red with a small to nonexistent head -- a thin white ring around the glass, with sparse carbonation. Fairly hazy. Smell is rich berry jam and oaky acid tartness.



Taste is similar -- rich berry jam, more on the oak and less on the acid, almost a funk to it, and something that hints at a butteriness, not diacetyl, but something that just makes it seem fuller and richer. Moderate fruit skin bitterness characteristic.



Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very dry. Overall, this is a very good beer.Jul 17, 2022"

Notes on label: ""For this Schaarbeekse Kriek, we macerated locally grown and manually harvested sour cherries for almost fourteen months in wooden barrels, with both one-year and two-year old lambik. The final fruit intensity is about 318 grams of Schaarbeekse per litre of finished Schaarbeekse Kriek. The average age of this beer upon release will be at least two-and-a-half years.""



Clear, cherry red colored body. Fizzy head quickly disappeared. No lacing.

Aroma is cherry, funk and oak. Funk is more leather and tobacco like. Indications of sourness but the oak gives off an old wood fibe.

Taste is quite sour, each sip leaves the mouth dry. There is a sour cherry flavor that still gives off a brief hint of fruit sweetness. At this time the funk flavor is showing less than what is in the nose, but remains in the leather and tobacco expression. Has quite a bit of oak tannins, especially on the exhale of the breath and in the released air from the stomach.

Medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.

Very good fruited lambic, although could likely increase more complexity and funk expression with bottle aging.Apr 16, 2022"

Is it a bit thinner for a ba stout? Sure. Does it have a ton of flavor, yes. The maple and coffee blend together for an awesome breakfast flavor. Sweet, not overly roasted. Vanilla and chocolate cake mixed in. Nice warming bourbon all throughout. This was a big surprise. I know it’s rated well, but just didn’t expect so much balanced flavors and drinkability.

4.45/5  rDev -0.9%
look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5Tar black body; very fizzy carbonation; thin, patchy, brown head. Rich, roasted and charred grain aroma; heavy chocolate presence; cocoa. Immense dark malt sweetness greets the palate; milk chocolate; coffee and caffeine; bourbon tones bleed midway through the malt sweetness and linger through the finish. Heavy body; dense, sticky residual sugars; huge alcohol warmth permeates through the density.



The initial appearance makes you think this is just another heavy-duty barrel-aged imperial stout. Distinction begins with the aroma, announces itself with the taste, and is undeniable with the incredible mouthfeel. An amazing stout!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Brief Review:



O: First Transient review for me I believe. Never really got into these guys as I'm more old school. But they're really making a name for themselves with the -uckley series with 2 of them in the Top 250 now. Most recent 2021 edition here, haven't seen 2022's yet. This one comes a bit hot for me. Little boozy and tingly on the tongue. Aroma is a little suppressed. Reminds me a bit of Vanilla Noir from Prairie if it had some maple syrup in it. Otherwise the pour and mouthfeel are nice and slick, which is impressive. It's a darn good beer, not gonna lie, but maybe not world-class for me right now. 



Recommendation: Decent offering from Transient here. They make a ton of BA stuff with lots of variants, so hard to get anything to stand out.Jun 03, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.52021 Release



Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with purple undertones. The beer has a modest sized dark beige head, that also has some purple undertones which faded fairly quickly to a nice ring. Nice looking Imperial Stout and the purple undertones are a nice touch..



Smell: Prominent raspberries, moderate Bourbon aromas and brown sugar aromas, and mild roasted malts/coffee aromas. The beer has a good nose featuring the raspberries.



Taste: The palate features raspberries, moderate bourbon notes, modest chocolate and roasted malt notes. The taste profile is nicely balanced and while the raspberries are very apparent all the flavor elements work well together. The beer starts off fairly sweet but dries up a bit. The beer has a mild alcohol presence for the listed 14.56% ABV.



Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation that results in a nice mouthfeel for this beer.



Overall: Another well done Bottle Logic stout. The taste profile nicely balances all the flavor elements resulting in a very cohesive taste profile. Very nice.Mar 07, 2021"

4.28/5  rDev -4.3%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Poured black and viscous - topped with an impressive (considering the ABV) brown head that reached a good 2 inches over the liquid. The lacing was just as impressive; it remained in the glass long after I finished.

The aroma, while mild to my chemically damaged nose (Invest in a decent respirator people!) still got through some dark fruits (plums, raisins) and bourbon. Hmm, smells pretty good.

Taste followed, along with some coffee; both in the warmth of the initial sip and the bitterness of an overly roasted bean. Interesting!

The feel was also very good; viscous enough for the ABV but not chewy- just nice, smooth sipping.

OA, this is a very good BA stout, and I'm a bit perplexed by it's sub top 100 in stouts ranking, but I suspect that means I just need to try more stouts.

Also, in my opinion alone, I believe the non BA version to taste a little better. I have to have them side by side to verify.May 25, 2022"

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%
look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Pours out like used motor oil; pitch black, capped with a creamy light brown head. Great retention and lacing that belies its abv. Like chocolate syrup with a toasted marshmallow on top.



I'm not picking up much aroma this time. Maybe it's too cold? I get molasses, dark chocolate, espresso, and bourbon for sure, though.



The flavor is dominated by rich dark chocolate, baking cocoa powder, espresso, bourbon, some butterscotch and caramel sweetness, tobacco, vanilla, oak, leather, and a hint of smoke. Coffee and earthy bitterness lingers, tamed by hints of bourbon sweetness.



The mouthfeel is thick, rich, oily, and fudgy. Ample carbonation prevents it from being too sludgy.



This is a wonderful BBA stout. Rich in flavor, doesn't detract from the flawless base beer.Mar 20, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25As an erstwhile Colorado native I proclaim this to be an excellent bourbon barrel aged stout. Personally I like the regular Ten Fiddy better, which I admit is strange. But that said, Oskar Blues did a fantastic job finding the right blend of bourbon barrels to impart a variety of interesting, well balanced nuances to the base stout. The oak and vanilla from the barrels are prominent but not overwhelming. There is a nice, burnt, candied sugar flavor, then the undertones of espresso and chocolate malts. Really quite fantastic overall.Feb 27, 2022"

The brew has been duly snifterized.... It's an oily, opaque black, with an attractive, rocky, dark mocha head. Lacing is solid all around the glass. Bourbon notes are the first things to hit the olfactories.... also present is Bosco-like choco, caramel and molasses, plus bourbon in the background. Mmmm... It's fairly smooth, though a bit less hefty in the body category, imo. I like my stouts full and chewy.



Taste mimics the aroma, with rich choco, vanilla, caramel/toffee, molasses, and hints of raisins and prunes. Again, lurking in the shadows is a pleasant layer of bourbon. A very nice brew, all around. Cheers!!

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Pours a firm burgundy color with a little haze to the transparency. A little protein build up floats in the glass. The first 3/4 of the bottle was poured into the glass for this review, with more sediment in the final quarter. Head is three fingers of off-white foam, which retains well. Aroma is sticky caramel, toffee, raisins, and bread pudding. A little yeast spice counters the initial sugary notes, with bready, caramely, light earthy malts firming up the whole thing. Clove adds a bit of herbal bite to the mid-section. Flavor profile is raisins, toffee, molasses, cinnamon, and almonds. Spicy yeast esters work well with bready, caramely, earthy malts to balance out the initial sugary notes, without smothering them out. In total, it has a hearty bread pudding taste without being over zealous in sweetness. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft, expansive effervescence that seems to feel bigger at the end than the start. This effect helps create a comforting, full feeling. Overall, some great malt and flavor undertones in both nose and taste. A comfortable blanket of a beer.

Pours a slightly hazy deep mahogany with minimal head, lots of tiny floaties suspended throughout, steady carbonation rising to the surface. 



Aroma is bready and sweet with notes of figs and dates, candi sugar, caramel. Delicate and nicely balanced. 



Taste is likewise bready, balanced, and complex. One thing that stands out here, that I often don’t notice, is the quality of the water—clean and refreshing with a subtle mineral quality, like a cold spring. Caramel, dark stone fruits, Belgian yeast. Some vaguely wintery spice and subtle Old World hops.



Mouthfeel is balanced and medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Finishes clean and crisp, just right. 



Overall, and not surprisingly, we have here a truly excellent, world-class dubbel. Maybe one of the best ones I’ve ever had.Apr 08, 2022"

Finishes bittersweet, with notes of estery fruity and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.



This actually feels very close to their Quadrupel for me, except maybe being not quite as rich, a little more carbonated and just a tad more roasted and bitter. For my personal taste, I probaly prefer it, to be honest. Still, without being quite worth its secondary price, this makes for a very impressive Dubbel that just stands slightly above offering such as Westmalle, St. Bernadus and Chimay due to its richness, balance and above all body and mouthfeel, with the estery character really standing out here.Jan 29, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...

L- Even rested/chilled it forms head really fast, so pour super-slow. Pours deep chestnut brown with slight haze and a mid-tan 6Cm head. There's fast rising CO2 micro-bubbles up the side of the nucleated glass. ps. Holds well and forms major lacing on the way down.

S- Strikingly deeply toasty and rich malts; it makes me imagine how a bag of ground up Maltesers might smell.

T- Again very malty, deep roasty, a notably fat but classy ABV% note crosses my palate, off into hops, then further rich malts and into a hoppier somewhat dry finish. Solid yet refined. Blimey, if you think this beer's reputation is hype, wait until you try it!

F- Rich deep roasty, the ABV% is clear enough it's similar to some liquor barrel aged beers. 

O- I picked this one for my 1950th review (the WestV12 will mark B2k). I was conscious of the brewery's repute and hype surrounding it, the difficulty getting their beer etc etc. Would I be underwhelmed, would I be underwhelmed but feel somehow obliged to rate it high. No way at all, this is a seriously luscious beer. Now perhaps some people might not like the fact that a 'mere' 8% beer lets you get an ABV% zing from it - some regard this as unclassy - but it works well within the rather glorious whole for me.

I'd happily drink this again, hell-ya, just maybe not at the cost it is imported into the UK!

The pour is mahogany brown with reddish hues under a boisterous, fluffy light tan head.



Lovely malt forward aroma sensations with Belgian spices and Belgian candied sugar.

The taste is a luscious malt forward sweetness with Belgian candied sugars and the slightest clove and coriander character. Just delightful.Jun 06, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5A relatively gentle pour into a tulip still resulted in loads and loads of fizzy, beige colored head with some decent lacing. This is a very active beer in the glass. After 5 minutes, the head is still almost an inch thick and continues to be actively reinforced by the carbonation from below. Color is dark cola brown with a nice reddish tinge. Aroma is malty and sweet with a hint of alcohol. 



Taste has a wonderful balance of sweet malts but with a nice dry finish. There's a complexity to this that I just can't place, but whatever those tastes are, they're working very well together. For me, the feel really shines. Medium+ bodied, plenty of carbonation but not overdone, and smooth in a way that really hides the alcohol. Very well done beer.Apr 04, 2021"

Pours black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge. Smells of oaky bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toffee and light coconut. Tastes of bold roasted notes up front give chocolate and char, followed by a compliment of barrel juice, oak, vanilla and caramel. The coconut develops near the finish, as well as more roast and barrel character. Medium-light body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a warming finishNov 04, 2020"

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. 22 oz bottle from the purchase at the brewery on 12/1/17 (Greatest Hits batch). Reviewed on 1/1/18. Poured into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.



A: Very dark brown to black, and opaque. A minimum of visible carbonation, and only a tan ring of foam. The foam stays around, but no real head formation.



S: Bourbon, chocolate, caramel, vanilla. Waffle cones and tobacco. Dark roasted malts with a modest roasty bitterness. Mild oak tannins. Quite a nice aroma, especially for non-adjunct stout.



T: Bourbon and dark chocolate, vanilla and caramel. Sticky dark roasted malts, milder coffee, Oak, tannins, more vanilla. Some drying tobacco within the tannins as well. Then more sweet bourbon and chocolate in the hang.



M: A nice heavy, thick and sticky body. Carbonation is low but fine for style. The alcohol flavors are very, very well-hidden for the monster ABV listed. Good barrel balance as well – obvious bourbon flavors but still lets the other flavors come out.



O: So…this is an excellent beer. Big sweet dark malty beer with good barrel presence and thick mouthfeel. BUT…I just had the Calusa Barrel-Aged Sworn to the Dark – and I think I might prefer the Calusa. It’s not a huge gap, and it’s rather like picking between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, since I really liked both of them. Would drink this one again in a heartbeat.Apr 05, 2020"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5To be clear this is absolutely a desert beer. Recommended to be had in s 4-6oz glass. Extremely thick dark color resembling black syrup. No head or carbonation. There’s a large amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut aromas. Looks, smells and tastes of hazelnut syrup. A little bit goes a long way. Arguably limited to no bourbon taste all hazelnut and chocolate syrup. Very unique goes well at the end of a meal with desert. 



This is one of the thicker stouts that I’ve ever had, just almost a solid instead of a liquid here. There’s no booziness, though.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 | overall: 3.5This one pours an exceptionally thick looking dark black color, with a small head, and a bit of sticky dark lacing.



This smells like incredibly sweet melted milkshakes – it smells good, but it’s just ridiculously over the top.



There’s an absurd amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut on the nose here – like a high quality hazelnut coffee thing. Like, it’s certainly tasty, objectively, but it’s just so over the top. More than 1 oz of this is more than enough. There’s basically no barrel, it’s just hazelnut, vanilla, and chocolate syrup overload.



This is one of the thicker stouts that I’ve ever had, just almost a solid instead of a liquid here. There’s no booziness, though.

My wife got me this one as a X-mas gift some time back, and I’ve been saving it for an occation… with yesterday being that day. The bold 600 ml bottle of B1 is looking really bubbly/curly when pouring in glass- but also: The nose is completely out-of-this-world, bursting with chocolate, hazelnuts and the thickest body imaginable. Mouthfeel is simply outstandingly incredible! This is quite possibly the best beer I’ve had- at least among the top 3. Long lasting, delicious taste that lingers. So happy I got to experience this one!Mar 23, 2022"

look: 3 | smell: 1 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 2.75Headlessly viscous burnt black with brown edges, the ominous appearance can't even begin to hint at just how HOLY SHIT WEIRD this 2021 bottle truly is.



Hazelnut paste quickly morphs into cashew cheese and buttered popcorn pot de creme that even verges into popcorn Jelly Belly, as one friend put it. But then my old lady described its nose as dirty dish rag and now I can't smell anything but.



We all had different glasses from different houses and this was our first pour during this bottle share, yet we all had the same offensive experience.



The mouthfeel is otherwise that thick and luscious, almost carbless globularity often hyptastically sought after these days, but not typically my own cup of tea. It clung ever so desperately to the kitchen sink as we drained pour the remaining putrescence.



How b2 has an over 4.5 rating on UnTappd is beyond me. What a bunch of sick, palate-wrecked liars. Speaking of, Anchorage's Sent By Liars is a far superior pastry stout if you're looking for something slightly more accessible that features these adjuncts.Mar 21, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Poured at fridge temp. Pours THICK like motor oil. Wow. Black with almost black head. The nose is incredible. Mostly hazelnuts upfront. Liquid hazelnut cream. Nutella all the way. It's almost hard to pick up much else. Over some time just sitting with the nose, I start to get some dark toffee, coconut, and more milk chocolate. Not a lot of barrel there. 



The taste is insane. More dimensions than the nose. Definitely still getting the hazelnut as the dominant flavor, but also picking up some bourbon, toffee, chocolate, molasses, sweet dark fruit. I might say it's a bit too sweet, which is where I dock it a few points. Otherwise, the taste is really nice.



The mouthfeel is ridiculous. So thick and creamy. I would say this is the thickest and creamiest stout I have ever tasted. Definitely a treat.Mar 05, 2022"

Black oil appearance with a short lived brown cap. Smell bursts forth with hazelnut, coconut, vanilla, dark chocolate, backed with complex barrel flavors. For the taste I must once again admit I am a hazelnut fan, so this was paradise for me, huge rich hazelnut and chocolate dance amongst the oak and bourbon soak coconut, vanilla, faint dark roast coffee, caramel, and nutella. Feel is thick, chewy, warm, has a hint of nuttiness but way more so rich, full and decadent with the weight.

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.75This is my review of the 2021 edition of Utopias. I regret missing missing the previous editions, this is my first. With much anticipation I waited for my local Total Wine to show it in stock & rushed over to hesitantly with $240. I’m more than a bit thrifty but I wanted to try this legendary brew. I ordered proper glassware to serve this ‘“beer”. Poured into a Glencairn whiskey glass, the headless, reddish liquid was a perfect match of the mahogany trim on my Stressless recliner. Aroma, I can’t imagine anything prettier, it would make a great perfume: bourbon, sherry, wine, caramel, maple & an abundance of barrel aromas. Flavor: far more complex flavors than my meeker palate can discern but here are few I can pick out, bourbon, wine, caramel, ripe fruit, vanilla with maple & tart cherries at the finish. There is no carbonation but plenty of alcohol, this definitely a sipper. It is delicious & it’s aroma is heavenly. Is it worth the high price? Probably not. Will I try another in future? Probably, at least one more. Besides, it matches my furniture.Apr 13, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5Is this a beer? Convince me! I bit the bullet when my local brew shop procured a trio of these for customers with more cash than sense. I've still got the bottle here on my desk, and it's a good way to start conversations with fellow hop heads.



Zero head, zero carbonation. A dark amber color that smells like a strong port. It tastes kind of like a port that was made from raisins and maple syrup instead of grapes. The mouthfeel is weirdly oily, probably due to the use of maple syrup in the brewing process. Best enjoyed in moderation, because it's gone before you know it.



I'm glad I had the experience, but I can't see myself getting it again. It's just way too expensive for what you get. The oily character was a little off-putting to me, and while I liked the strong raisin flavor, I wasn't as fond of the maple. And in no way is it experienced like something you'd call ""beer."" You take careful shots, there's no carbonation, and it's stronger than many cocktails.



It's probably not fair for me to call it ""overrated,"" and given the expense of brewing it, I can't quite say it's overpriced. But the experience was more costly than it was worth for me.Dec 16, 2021"

I am not sure is this should be called a beer. Drinks like a port wine or Sherry.

Bold notes of dark fruit and hints of licorice.

It was a nice experience but a am not sure of buying a full bottle of it.

Maybe when I win the lottery I put one of these babies on my shelf.Nov 14, 2021"

T:. The strong booze coats the tongue first, followed by mounds of sweet maple and molasses, becomes quite reminiscent of whiskey, some notes of vanilla and a light cinnamon, don't get a tone of the cherry but a very slight note of them. Once again the booze is noticeable and drinks a lot more like hard liquor than beer.



F:. No carbonation, creamy smooth, strong heat from the alcohol



O:. This is a very interesting beer and very good, but too me it doesn't quite live up to the price or the hype.Nov 14, 2021"

Here we are BA, my personal whale. Sam Adams Utopias. Me and my buddy Pru managed to find a bottle about 2 hours from home because we just couldn’t wait for this year’s release. This is also beer #800 for me! I’m very excited to break into this, so I’m gonna stop wasting time and open it up



Obviously this is not a beautiful pour for beer, but the presentation of the bottle alone is worth a 5. Pours clear dark amber with no head but nice legs



It’s very evident that this was brewed with maple syrup, as the nose is a mapley booze bomb. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy bourbon, sticky maple, cinnamon, sweet vanilla, rum raisin, smooth oak, dark cherry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and a touch of honey



This is super sweet in taste, somewhere in between a barleywine and a bourbon or cognac. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting strong maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, dried plum, and burnt sugar. The swallow has a pretty decent burn and brings notes of sweet maple syrup, black cherry, spicy bourbon, buttery oak, brown sugar, creamy vanilla, dried plum, sherry, fig, and a touch of cocoa



A medium full body with almost no carbonation, just an alcoholic tingle resulting in a rich beer. Finishes somewhat dry but quite sweet



This is not necessarily an amazing beer, and not even necessarily a beer. However, it’s really a once in a lifetime experience, and I am thoroughly enjoying it. To good beer and better freiends!Oct 02, 2021"

look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Excited to finally have a Utopias. Only a 2019 but the experience of unboxing it and pouring the bottle is second to none. Sharing this bottle with my bud Rug. Based off looks, phenomenal. Never before had to unbox a beer. Smells strong, gives a bourbon vibe and hints of cinnamon. Slightly burns to smell but that’s to be expected with a beer of this alcohol percentage. Tastes strongly of maple syrup, and bourbon. Hints of cinnamon in the background. Medium feel, finishes sticky. Overall a phenomenal experience. Not anything phenomenal to the senses, but one any craft beer fan should have.Oct 02, 2021"

Consumed 5/23/21



Stickee has always been a favorite for me. I love a great quad and Firestone does an amazing job adding a barrel aged component. The nose is wonderful. The barrel is prominent and it’s perfectly sweet. I don’t know what the aging has done to this bottle. It’s super smooth but was it harsh before? I doubt it. I’d probably drink this fresh in the future. A world class beer and perhaps the best quad you can find? One day I’ll find a Westy 12 to test that theory.May 24, 2021"

A: Poured into a snifter to a deep brown beer which is topped by a finger of dense and slightly rocky light tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass

S: Smells of tons of dark fruits, caramel and toffee along with a nice touch of oak

T: Taste is caramel and toffee up front before some dark fruits come in. Nice bready malt with a huge amount of sugary sweetness along with some hints of oak and vanilla. On the swallow there's more brown sugar sweetness, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, oak, and vanilla.

M: This beer is on the heavier side of things with a silky feel on the palate. Carbonation is soft but adequate for the style while the ABV ensures that this beer has a dying finish.

O: Overall this beer rocks the house. A huge amount of complexity makes this a beer that demands to be sipped and savored. Alcohol is hidden very well. It's also held up very well to the test of time and shows no signs of off flavors.Apr 10, 2021"

It poured as black as ink with a small brown head that faded slowly and left basically zero lacing. It smells of cinnamon, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds and roasted peppers up front, followed by cocoa powder, brown sugar, charred wood and cooking spices. The ABV was quite subdued in the nose.



Tastes of dark chocolate and smoked chili peppers up front, followed by cinnamon, milk chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, roasted grains, cocoa powder, brown sugar, molasses, red wine, charred wood and cooking spices. The flavor has a lot of smoky, charred aspects but still does down easy like a well aged bourbon. The char and oaky components give it some hints of vanilla and campfire smoke, while covering up the ABV. Pretty smooth drinking for a heavy stout, this was quite enjoyable.May 07, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Crowler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck on 3/26/22, unknown vintage but presumably the latest release from 2021



Yet another legendary Stout acquired at Half Time yesterday! The difference in rankings between this and the barrel aged version of it is shocking to me, at #245 vs #3, respectively. Still, I’m expecting a quality beer with this one. Let’s get into it



Pours jet black with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing



The peppery spice in the nose is really nice, it combines well with everything. I’m picking up on aromas of chipotle pepper, earthy cinnamon, roasty coffee, milk chocolate, spicy whiskey, light raisin, and vanilla



The balance carries over into taste, with the pepper adding a nice but firm spice. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, chili pepper, dates, and vanilla. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, vanilla, spicy whiskey, roasty coffee, and toasted oak



A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice sweetness



This is a very good beer. The balance is really nice and nothing is overwhelming. I can’t wait to try the BA versionMar 27, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Perennial Abraxas Imperial Stout 2021, 11.5% ABV. Pours black and thick with a one-finger medium brown head that left no lacing but the cap lingered. Nose is chocolate, cinnamon, and faint peppers. Taste follows, weak pepper, plus vanilla. The more it warmed, the cinnamon really popped, nose and taste. Excellent smooth and thick mouthfeel, overall world class. Way better than Prairie Bomb or Stone Xocoveza.Mar 06, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75If you're a fan of Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, then congrats - you're already a fan of Abraxas.



A pretty leisurely pour into an imperial pint glass produced a thick, beautiful 4 inch tan head. The head itself appeared slowly and almost dramatically, and only after I'd stopped pouring. It breaks down slowly, forming a 1/2"" cap with fantastic lacing.



Smelled of molasses, cinnamon, cacao, and chilies. This is a beautiful aroma, very reminiscent of Christmas Bomb, but smoother and more refined.



Taste followed the nose, but with pronounced maltiness that really ties the whole thing together. Too often, winter releases use cinnamon either to conceal deficiencies or act as second fiddle to sugar or honey. Abraxas employs the chilies and cinnamon to great effect, creating a flavor profile that perfectly compliments the vanilla and cacao. To drink this brew is to drink mastery in action.



The mouthfeel of this beer is complex. Drink it before the head dissipates, and you have a milkshake. Drink it after the head reduces down to a 1/2"" cap, and you have a thick, viscous, smooth delight. Very light carbonation.



I paid around $25 for a 750ml bottle, and it was worth every penny. This is perfect for a Christmas get together, or just a cold winter night. Most definitely in the same class as Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, but Abraxas is the elder statesman of the group. Buy it, and be prepared to be amazed.Dec 27, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5750 ml bottle, no bottle date that I noticed on it but it's a 2021 vintage, 11.5% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch or so frothy tan head that stuck around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like Ancho chilies, cinnamon, vanilla, roasted malt, cacao nibs and some earthiness. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some dark bread, coffee and burnt/charred malt flavors. I think all the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy and coating with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Easy and enjoyable to drink for sure. I thought this was a pretty good overall brew, worth picking up if you get the chance!Dec 23, 2021"

It was one that really stood out and I enjoyed them all. Had it a few months after that because I found it at my favorite beer shop(the only place I know that almost exclusively sells nothing but beer and a small selection of liquor). It was just as good as the first time. The only beer I've had that's similar in taste to this is Firestone-Walker's Mole Merkin. There's a ton of flavor in this beer but they all mix together quite wonderfully. This is one of my favorite beers, I'm big on stouts and this one is up there with the best of em . Update for 2021-2022 version, it was as good as the first time I've tried it. One of my all time favorite beers, I can't recommended it enough! If anyone sees it out in the wild definitely pick it up because it can be quiet hard to come by, even for locals.Oct 29, 2021"

Scored this bad-boy pre-aged from the best beer store in the state (shhhh... it was $6)



Pours up black, smelling boozy and woody. This is breakfast in my ****ed-up world, cheers! Extremely milk chocolate sweet but the sweetness is thankfully cut by the barrel and spirits. But still, molasses, raisin, mocha coffee dominate. It's drinkable, but HOT, even considering the 11.4%. Other 'competitors' cover up the alc more betterer, but maybe that's the point here. If you are a boozer, you may appreciate this aspect more; me, I'm a beer'er and this is too busy to be beer. I'm a purist in a weird way, and this just has too much going on. The wine and oak don't add anything, it's just all harsh grain alcohol cutting through saccharine dark fruit. Perfectly drinkable, but why?Aug 21, 2021"

Dirty motor oil, I guess. 

If my car ran on The Abyss I would do much more walking and biking. 

It’s dark. Like an abyss! Wow, ironic!

It smells like cocoa malt candy joy. It smells like Jamaican Blue Mountain if it was half as good as they say. 

The taste absolutely follows. It’s all been said before. Malty chocolate caramel licorice dark fruit heaven. It’s good! There’s some alcohol in that taste, however, more than most are willing to say. 

You guys try that French toast version that’s around in 2021? Odd! Add cinnamon and maple to the above and you have it. 

It’s good. As I have said here before, better does exist. BBA Darkness, for example. But Abyss is lovely!Aug 05, 2021"

Looks decent enough in a large wine glass. Jet black body, small tan head doesn't last too long, hence not much lacing.



Faintly boozy aroma, almost RIS-like. A little molasses, faint smoke.



On tasting, the roast is pretty strong on this one. There are some dark fruit notes, and some warmth from the barrel. Light bourbon notes. Does feel smooth rolling around the tongue. Some molasses, and even faint soy.



Mouth between medium and full, finish a warm boozy roast.



Overall, not as good as I hoped, roast a bit much for this palate.Jun 20, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Pours a pitch-black coloration with a small, fizzy head that quickly recedes. Smells of slightly roasted, caramel malt and distinct chocolate and vanilla notes, as well as some cinnamon and hints of licorice and oak. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, caramel malt, strong milk chocolate and vanilla, lighter cinnamon and chili heat, as well as hints of dark fruit, with accents of raisin and fig, licorice, leather and bourbon-infused oak. Finishes with a light sweetness and some chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and a pleasant chili heat lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.



It's been so long since I managed to get my hands on a decent mexican chocolate stout, so this BBA brew goes down a real treat. I've had regular Oro Negro before and really enjoyed it, while the BBA version feels a lot richer, with the bourbon character coming through marvellously here. While this also makes the beer a little bit more sweet and boozy, with that bourbon and additional vanilla notes really standing out, the spice and roasted notes balance this out very nicely, with the chili heat being just right for my personal taste. Overall, this makes for a very rich mexican chocolate stout with an excellent balance of sweet and spicy notes and a great bourbon character, as well as full body and mouthfeel.Apr 03, 2022"

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25Modest head production and retention, but it's not completely still.



Wonderful aroma. Bourbon isn't as prominent as other Jackie O's BBA stouts. Smooth and semi-sweet, with vegetal pepper notes along chocolate and vanilla.



Really nice melange of flavors on the palate. Peppers are very restrained, noticeable for my palate only from very large sips - but I get very little pepper in chili beers normally unless it's strong and prominent. Chocolate is rich and smooth; the vanilla is complementary; I don't get any cinnamon; the bourbon, as with the nose, is restrained but wonderfully complementary. Overall flavor is a big, semi-sweet imperial stout, arguably more of a dessert stout than a chili stout - quite reminiscent of the last few years of Mexican Cake.



Mouthfeel is adequately full and lively; I would prefer both more thickness and more activity, but it's a very drinkable beer.Jan 09, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Pours inky black with minimal head. Aroma of roasted almonds, chocolate syrup on the nose. Some vanilla and oak as well. Lots of chocolatey notes in this one. Some vanilla and oaky burn on the finish. It's not super sweet, but there's enough sweetness. It's lean and doesn't have the heft of the some of the thiccer bois you hear a lot about these days. The heat from the habañero burn is unignorable on this hot summer day and the idea that it's always stout season seems incomprehensible at the moment. This is a nice stout though and it's always cool to get a top 250 beer in distro.Aug 26, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.7512 oz bottle, poured into a goblet at 40 degrees F and allowed to warm during consumption.



L: Poured an inky black with no real head to speak of, and what little did form vanished quite swiftly.



S: Thick black bread leapt out of the bottle upon the cap being removed, and swirled in the air during the pour. Alongside it, blackstrap molasses, petrichor with fresh herb garden topsoil, chopped walnut, and oaky booze are prominent in the nose when cold. As it warms, the walnut aroma becomes far more prevalent.



T: When cold, this opens as a mouthful of herb garden soil just after a spring rain, with both chopped walnut and wet green walnut husk present. Black bread lurks in the background, and oaky tannic barrel notes slither around the edges. The aftertaste contains a touch of spicy heat. As it warms, those characteristics remain, but additional layers begin to appear - some dark sugary fruit like raisins, figs, and dates, molasses, a tinge of leather, and some distant cocoa. The heat remains in the aftertaste.



F: Full and thick, this brings to mind liquid bread blended to syrup.



O: This is a complex delight of a barrel-aged stout. But hey, it's Jackie O's. They're not exactly a slouch of a brewery.Jul 25, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25A- 375ml bottle pours into a tulip glass with a motor oil black body. The foam that forms on the beer is a light brown and has a puffy texture. The head rises to a finger high and has decent retention. Not a ton of lacing but a few small webs and some spottiness.



S- Woah, didn't expect the walnuts to make a massive difference but the first thing I smell upon pouring the bottle, from a few feet away, is toasted walnuts. The nuts combine with the roasted malts, which are chocolately and fudgey, as well as some caramel notes to remind me of turtles or a nutty, caramel chocolate treat. Bourbon barrel comes next with some vanilla sweets, slight wood and hints of whiskey. Strong cocoa as well as hints of earthy cinnamon. Not picking up on the peppers here.



T- Not quite as nutty as the aroma but the walnuts are still present throughout and one of the main flavors along with the cocoa and the barrel which gains considerable strength on the palate. A bit of habanero heat in the finish but no obvious pepper flavor, which is probably a good thing if we are being honest. Vanilla beans are strong with caramel, milk chocolate, roast barley, spicy Bourbon, medium toast oak and spicy cinnamon notes.



MF- Medium bodied and a little bit thinner than I expected after smelling and tasting this one. I guess it just lacks creaminess and is lightly frothy instead. Fairly slick and oily but not syrupy. The carbonation is moderate and it finishes with moderate alcohol warming and some heat from the peppers.



Reminds me of a walnut, caramel and chocolate cluster and I am impressed by how much the walnuts are expressed in the final brew. The flavor is where things really balance out nicely but the body could be just a bit creamier if I am being honest.Jan 01, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours a very dark brown with no head formation after a modest pour straight into the glass. Some oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl. Aroma is dark fruits, fig, toffee, and brown sugar with a hearty throughout. Caramel, toasty, and light bready malts shape the rest of the beer aroma profile. Sweet cognac and light bourbon heat pair up with barrel character for a subtle twist of heat within an otherwise sugar nose. Flavor profile is cognac booze right up front, paired together with dark fruits and figs. After the opening act, bourbon, brown sugar, almond, and grassy, herbal hops take over, forming a slightly sticky, firmly sweet flavor profile. Barrel character is minor, instead allowing individual liquors to shine and simmer in the spotlight. Wonderful dynamics and shape from start to finish. Mouth feel is a boiled-over-medium texture with a near still effervescence that carries a consistent minor fluffiness throughout. Just a little bit plush, but mostly flat. Thickness is medium-thick. Overall, really incredible use of various liquor influences to enhance and build on a dark fruit, fig, and toffee forward ale. Despite only being 11.37% ABV for this batch's bottling, it's a powerhouse of flavor.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.752021 vintage, 11.37 ABV



Just what I hoped it'd be. The barrels are prominent, I get some bourbon and plenty of brandy/cognac, can't quite tease these two apart but I taste plenty of boozy fruit. They also bring hints of vanilla and leather. An incredibly decadent base beer shines through as well. Quite sweet, with notes of toffee, brown sugar, cherry, figs, and so much more. I love the lingering boozy exhale. The body is full and sticky with light carbonation. Lives up to the hype.Apr 14, 2022"

4.72/5  rDev +4%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Pours a dark ruby tinged brown color. Opaque and shiny. Thin, velvety tan head forms on the beer before dissipating. The only residual head is a thin ring of foam along the outside of the top of the beer. Aroma is incredibly rich and pungent for a barleywine. There are notes of rich bread, fruit cake, dark fruit and overly ripe cherries, toffee, burnt brown sugar, vanilla, along with strong barrel notes that carry notes of each - cognac, brandy, and bourbon.



Taste follows the nose with notes of boozy fruit cake, dark cherries, oak, light tannic notes, toffee, brown sugar, with light notes of vanilla and cocoa with a slight cherry tartness on the back end. Lots of barrel character comes through with clear notes of brandy, bourbon, and cognac showing up in the profile. Its sweet - not too sweet, but definitely on the sweeter side of barleywines. The profile overall is decadent, rich and flavorful. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and viscous. Carbonation is sprightly but nicely balanced. Trending dry on the finish.



Overall this is an amazing barleywine - I know I have used the word decadent multiple times in the review, but it really is the best way to describe this beer.Dec 12, 2021"

look: 3.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.52021 vintage (batch 8). Poured from a 500mL bottle into my snifter. 



Opaque, seal brown liquid with a low dun collar. Very fine lacing; fast running legs; poor retention. 



Bourbon, molasses, winter spices, baker's chocolate, fresh dates, and roast malt in the nose. 



Flavor follows the nose but with significantly more intensity and complexity. Rye and hops blend together with a bit of heat from the alcohol. Long, even, medium-dry finish with hints of loam and char. Faint tobacco, vanilla, and coconut emerge as the ale warms. 



Medium bodied, faintly oily, with low but sufficient carbonation. 



Bourbon forward with several layers of flavor - one of the better tasting examples of the style.May 28, 2022"

Taste - Coffee was very evident with a Bourbon also being apparent. Molasses sweetness was strikingly noted as well. Dark chocolate round out the finish.

4.3/5  rDev -4%
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Pours pitch black with a finger of tan foam. Aroma is roasty, toasty, and caramely malts. It's accentuated by chocolate, vanilla bean, and some mild char, adding sweetness and bitterness, respectively. Big and bold on the nose. Flavor profile leads with more sweetness - vanilla bean, molasses, caramel, and chocolate. Roasty and toasty malts lay underneath, keeping the beer from listing into sugary, and doing their darndest at that. A touch of barrel char at the end insures balance. Mouth feel is thick with a consistent, creamy texture. That creaminess keeps it easy to drink despite the alcohol content or the weight of each sip. Overall, smooth and bold with a focused push of vanilla bean

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.52019 release. I received this from @2beerdogs. Poured into a snifter. It pours nearly black with a full finger of creamy, medium-mocha lacing with excellent retention considering the alcohol level. On the nose there is roasted malt, char, tobacco smoke, toffee, and a strong scent of bourbon. The taste is considerably sweeter than the smell would indicate. It opens with fudgy chocolate, vanilla, and molasses with hints of dark fruit in the background. The Buffalo Trace bourbon is strong and warming but the overall flavor has a soft quality. Its mouth feel is plush and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and I can really feel the 14.09% ABV. Overall, Darkstar November is a huge Russian Imperial Stout with loads of flavor. It's a great sipper and I'm grateful to have tried it.Nov 27, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Alan, thank you so much for this one. 



2019 vintage - 375ml bottle - poured into a Zinfandel stem at 45°F.



With a loud, forceful *POP* of the cap, Juicy pours a slightly foggy deep burnish orange-amber hue - rather dark, forming just a razor-thin collar with some slow lazy rising bubbles.



Nose: My goodness, this is striking. This is a mandarin orange - freshly peeled and squeezed until the juice begins to run. Not naval, not Cara Cara, not mineola - mandarin - joined by gooseberry, white grape, Meyer lemon, apricot, gingerbeer, green apple, cloudberry jam, all swirling amidst some subtle barnyard funk, wet hay, petrichor, cellar stone, wet leaves, wine-soaked oak, old books, some zesty acidity, and these immensely complex perfume notes. This may be the single most impressive aroma I've encountered. My first ever 5 on anything. I don't hand those out...



Palate: Juicy greets the palate with that soft, restrained Hill Farmstead tartness - citrusy - with a noticeable malt sweetness behind it. There's almost some IPA influence, with juicy flavours of grapefruit, pineapple, fresh grass, gooseberry, white grape, and some serious sauvignon blanc influence. Mid-way, the subtle acidity fades, revealing some grainy malt, and a musty, overripe dankness emerges. The brighter fruity notes begin to give in to some grassy character, orange pith, lime leaf, and some bitter peach pit. Some resinous Nelson hop character emerges, still bacled by some lemon zest, and then vinous wine cask, tannic grape skin, and lightly bitter hop resinous waft through the finish.



Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-bodied, with a touch of weight to it, despite its small size. Effervescence is ultra-fine - on par with champagne, but much, much softer. Some dry tartness up front, fading to semi-dry with grain poking through, and then finishing mostly dry, with some tannins and resinous hop oil cling.



Overall: This is a truly spectacular example of what creativity, nuance, and new boundaries can achieve. This farmhouse ale displays a rare quality of not really having an equal - as in, nothing really compares to it. It's a saison, but it has some pale ale spirit, but it Nelson-hopped, with theae heady, exotic elements that pair seamlessly and beautifully with the wine barrel, and everything about it is so perfectly rounded and softened, like a river rock smoothed by the waters of time. One of those rare, inspiring bottles that just sings in harmony.Jan 22, 2021"

Bottle to snifter. Share with DC.



Look: swirling foamy eggshell head. Excellent retention.





Aroma: Chardonnay, perfume, floral, very pungent aroma.



Taste: ginger ale, white grape, ester, ash



Feel: Dry finish. Medium body and excellent carbonation.



Very excellent and unique. Changes as you sip. Each attribute seems to add to the whole in unexpected ways. Kind of like a wine spritzer.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25375ml undated bottle from the most recent release.



Pours hazy copper with a half inch head of white with a vigorous pour. Minimal retention or lacing. Surprisingly low carbonation for the style. Light notes of cider vinegar, grape must, wine barrel, and wet hay in the nose. Light bodied with a slickish, thinnish mouthfeel. Vineous and tart on the palate with undertones of Burgundy, citrus, and apples. Finishes fairly dry with some lingering tannins, red fruit, and grapeskins.



Nice beer but proper carbonation for the style would really help the aromatics and mouthfeel. Not really getting a ""juicy"" impression either.Oct 15, 2020"

L: pours a perfectly clear gold/amber with a moderate white head that fades after a couple minutes. Leaves a great ring of foam around the edge with some moderate lacing



S: lives to its name with the first whiff, really gorgeous and deep tropical fruit and citrus aroma. Followed behind by a mild tart/barnyard funk and great depth from the wine barrel aging. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, some apricot, orange, pleasant acidity



T: follows the nose well, fruit nose comes through but takes a backseat to the base ale. Slightly funky, nicely tart farmhouse flavor with some notable wine barrel structure and depth. Fruit there from the nose, increasing as it’s warmed. Again grapefruit and pineapple, more of that orange as well as apricot. Medium long finish



F: light+/medium- body, medium/medium+ carbonation, slightly drying, moderate acidity



O: a delicious farmhouse ale (no surprise there) with a really great and differentiated nose. Up against stiff competition with the rest of the HF line-up, manages to differentiate itself wellSep 25, 2020"

Oh well, got to be happy it’s even doing curbside. I just wanted to try this when I was looking at potential beers and am super happy I did. I really like sours and while this isn’t a sour the Juicy was, for me, close. But this didn’t overwhelm me with tart at all. Just a great blend and very easy going down. I know it’s not a sour but if it was it would be my favorite of all that I have had. Pours a light color, slight head, not much lacing, lingered nicely in my mouth and I could smell it just when I opened it before I poured it. Wonderful beer. Kind of wish I had purchased a couple more than just my two. Would have loved it in a 750 ml bottle though. Just not enough of it.Aug 27, 2020"

Aroma is rich and full roasty and toasty malts with caramely, nutty and bready malts adding a little further depth and complexity. Molasses, chocolate, spices, bourbon and oak add a little further depth and complexity, balancing out the initial malts with a little sweetness and heat, respectively. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty, nutty, bready malts for a firm, thick stout base. Spices, cinnamon, molasses, chocolate and toffee add a little dry sweetness that gets rinsed away by a touch of bourbon heat and oaky char. Mouth feel is thick and full with a chewy, lightly grainy texture. Overall, rich and full with a light spice character to add further depth to the otherwise clean and straightforward barrel aged stout. It's complex and full, with a big surprise in every sip.

The beer is like your childhood - but barrel aged. Huge fucking BARREL AGED nutmeg in your face. Cinnamon. It's so Christmas-y, and rich and full. Tons of fudge in the background with hot caramel sauce and peppermint coffee. Fading notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, fudge, and bourbon. This is magic. 



Feel is a bit thin from the barrel but still within thick stout territory. Alcohol heat is evident and welcome, with a slightly slick feel and a hot finish. Good carbonation too. 



Overall,. an absolutely phenomenal, incredible beer that I wish I could find here in Tulsa to take home via package liquor but unfortunately could not. Do not waste your time on mediocre beer. Life is too short. That is the greatest lesson I have learned in 3,000+ beers. If they suck, walk. Prairie does not. Worth the $17, even at the bar. Created a memory burned into my brain. THAT IS TRUE BEER!!! I would have to have Apple Brandy Noir side-by-side to compare, but this may be the best Prairie beer ever made.Jan 10, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5If the emperor gets to wear new clothes then this king of stouts dons its Christmas attire! This time enveloped in bourbon drenched Santa suit, the flavors of the Christmas Bomb! imperial stout are brought to the palate with generous additions of holiday spice and the warmth of the bourbon barrel.



Much like thatch, the Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb layers in the glass with a patient swirl of coffee-like creme. Ominously dark and carrying a mirror-like sheen, the deep and deviant perfume overcomes the nose with espresso, holiday spice, dark chocolate, grilled fruit, vanilla, whisky and cream. Its lavish taste slathers the early palate with toffee, vanilla, molasses and a general gingerbread flavor before the chocolate and char follows closely behind.



Develops a more earthy character through the middle palate, those fresh flavors are decadent with bittersweet chocolates and roasting walnut in its bitterness power. A syrupy chocolate taste and texture is matched with the spiciness of sharp cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove and vanilla as the barrel's taste of oak, caramel, toasted cherry and grape give a soft vinous tone in the end.



Remaining rich, viscous and off-chewy, the beer's full and creamy body weighs on the tongue with the low-lying carbonation that ensures full saturation of the tastebuds. Trailing with a long, heated warmth of good 'ole Kentucky bourbon, its the chocolate and vanilla that provide balance with a simmering warmth of holiday spice in mulled ale form.Dec 31, 2019"

look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75Very clear, light gold body; lively carbonation; no head. Nice farmhouse smells; barnyard funk, fresh cut hay, some lemon and other citrus notes. Very pleasant flavors; sweet white wine; green apple, lemon, raspberry, and peach; tart. Moderately heavy body; smooth and rather flat; very acidic overall with a touch of underlying sweetness for depth.



I heard good things about this beer and paid a pretty price for it ($65, actually ordered it by mistake, but so it goes). Overall, this is a decent beer for the style but not something I think warrants the price paid for it.

A huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade! It’s the highest rated Bière de Champagne (and #245 overall), so it’s only fitting to drink this baby on New Years Eve. The rest of the day/night will consist of old classics, but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. Let’s get into it



Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. Eventually fades to absolutely nothing but it's still a decent looking beer



Man, I'm really digging the nose on this one, funky and delicate at the same time. I'm picking up on aromas of white grape, white wine vinegar, tangerine, sharp oak, and earthy apple



It's straight up explosive in taste, in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart green apple, sour white grape, wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, and crackery malt. The swallow brings notes of earthy white white, old leather, tart white grape, apple skin, sharp oak, floral honey, and lemon zest 



A light medium body pairs with fine carbonation, resulting in a tart and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness



This is great stuff, and a great kickoff to NYE. It's been a hell of a 2021, both on here and in my life and general. So, cheers BA, happy new year!Dec 31, 2021"

Appearance: A clear golden colour with a half finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass while leaving only sparse lacing.



Aroma: Sweet, lightly tart, vinous, white grape, oak, honey, with light funky notes.



Taste: Sour, tart, vinous, white wine grapes, honey, oak, funk, with notes of sharp acidity but not overly so.

It pours a cloudy, bright orange. It looks like Orangina. The head fizzled away almost immediately but that is typical for the style. The nose is just superb: like a fine Chardonnay; I'm smelling lemon, orange peel, and peach. It's taste is sublime; funky, oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the Brettanomyces and native Missouri microflora. It's so delicate and fine. It has the expected effervescence and it doesn't drink like 10% ABV. Overall, Blanc De Blancs is an absolute delight. I'm privileged to have had the chance to try it.Oct 17, 2021"

T: Boozy figs, slight vanilla bean, hint of cacao, and a splash of dark rum

O: Nice Black Tuesday variant - the rum is a bit restrained on this batch, perhaps, but embodies the mammoth flavors that are signature to Black Tuesday. Bold, boozy, and makes a statementMar 20, 2021"

Aroma is deep dark chocolate, coffee grounds, vanilla bean, toffee, and actually a little alcohol is present for sure. 4.25



Taste follows dark chocolate, roasty coffee, vanilla, toffee, and a little alcohol in the lingering finish. 4.25



Mouthfeel bigger than average, soft carbonation, a little dry, and at 9.3% it drinks bigger. 4



Overall this one would be better if it had more body in my opinion, but still a very solid Imperial Stout. 4Feb 20, 2022"

Man, I can’t remember the last new Stout I had from Tree House. They tend to excel at these Milk Stouts, so I have high hopes for this one. Plus this is one of the last few TH beers in the BA top 250 I’ve yet to rate, so I’m excited to finish up that list



Pours nearly pitch black with a finger of mocha head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing



This is certainly sweet in aroma, but it’s not overbearing. I’m picking up on aromas of milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, chewy caramel, sweet vanilla, light cinnamon, and a touch of char



There’s actually a pretty good sense of balance here in taste, I wasn’t expecting a dry finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, chewy caramel, raisin, creamy coffee, brown sugar, light cherry, and cocoa powder. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, dark cherry, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, light caramel, and roasted malt



A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and creamy beer. Dries out over the duration of the swallow, leaving just the slightest stickiness



Damn, this is really good. Nothing overpowering but still full flavored. Hopefully they put this one out more oftenFeb 07, 2022"

4.58/5  rDev +1.8%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Grabbed can at Perfect about 8 months ago. Lost/ Found in beer fridge today. 

Unsure fresh, but this beer at 8 months is a monster across the board. 

Gorgeous slightly orange hinted golden yellow; hazy with a creamy thick white head… which breaks down into layers of dense foam that cascade in multiple halos within glass.

Nose is citric orange; grass; melon, double bubble . Flavor mirrors with more noticeable apricot tartness and some banana like richness coming through as well. 

Body is velvety smooth only lightly carbonated. Rich but not heavy or sluggish. Not for everyone but spot on in my wheel house. Seems almost hand pulled from cask. Absolutely no double digit ABV noticeable at all. Mastercrafting here.

Overall I just had to bump it up a bit the sum is even better than the amazing parts. Big bow here.Apr 16, 2022"

4.18/5  rDev -7.1%
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Poured a golden-orange body with two-finger head that slowly died and left a lace ring down the glass. Aroma struck me as a mix of mild grapefruit and citric hops along with smidge of tropical fruits and floral notes. Fuller-bodied, slightly sticky, a touch of booze and maltiness in the beer but mostly a tropical fruit sweetness that balances with a floral hoppiness and then a touch of citric zip on the finish. Great balance between different aspects and well-hidden booze make this an enjoyable beer.Nov 17, 2021"

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75So first question: Is this the same as the HDHC Triple Citra Daydream Collab with EQ? Second question. Have you ever walked into a brewery right after the brewers throw hops into the boil? Well that's exactly what this beer smells like once it's poured. Light hazy gold. Thick white head. Crazy, ridiculous long lasting head and thick lacing. Really something else for a beer of this ABV. Super green hops and sweaty gym clothes followed by bubble gum, berries, mango..... Taste is more bubble gum, grapefruit, green, mango. Feel is medium carbonation. Fluffy body. Overall, a hop lover's delight.Nov 15, 2021"

Pours a turbid mango-gold body topped with a rounded, fluffy two and a half fingers of white foam; excellent head retention leaves a mound of cap, a slight, frothy collar, and a moderate spread of soapy, spotty lacing around the walls of the glass.



Aroma shows traces of resin as it opens, withholding overripe peach, papaya, hints of bready malt, and guava briefly as the bouquet develops; creamier tones of mango build, further accentuating guava, tangerine zest, and slight suggestions of peach and pink grapefruit over time; a lush, tropical bouquet with defined, hoppy edges.



Taste offers lime sherbet upfront, a semi-tart introduction to what is eventually a touch piney over the mid-palate and effectively accented with peppery, pithy citrus zest; pineapple, bay leaf, and apricot zest show depth into the back end as overripe mango and sweet bready malts shine into the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium body alongside a mild carbonation deferring to a significant creamy texture dominant into the mid-palate, where a prickly resin into the back end glides toward an increasingly slick, stiff, yet easy finish.



A great entry into the NETIPA category, perpetuating in equal parts the tempered abrasion matched by the burly profile which can be found in this (sub-) style; a pointed alcohol presence, abundance of flavor, and creamy, weighted texture to tie it all together; spectacularly consumable 11.5% ABV.Oct 19, 2020"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75L - murky pour with thick, impenetrable haze. Looks like mud. Dark orange mango juice. Menacing, almost. Big-bubbled head that dissipates a little less quickly than typical Trillium fare, but I can already tell it's not going to stick around long.



S - hits hard with lime and bread. Toasted orange peel and graham crackers. Pithy pineapple, vegetal qualities, and hop puree. Smells like choking down hops. That's a good thing. If hops were air, I could breathe this.



T - lively burst of grapefruit juice. Some serious depth of flavor, featuring papaya, guava, apricot, and bubblegum if ""hops"" were a flavor. Warming, doughy orange peel and loads of citrus pith. Oat bitterness. Full and suffocating in flav. Rindy OJ, complete with pulp. Pineapple freshness. Syrupy candy on the finish that quicky zips it up with some tingly bitterness and lingering dryness.



F - pillowy. Yes, generic description, but it's true. It's seriously full and satisfying. An elixir to behold.



O - just wow. Such flavor range. Like wringing out every last bitter drop of your favorite ball of citrus. If I lived in the middle ages, I might think this has healing properties. In fact, I think I might be coming down with something (bit of a sore throat), but this is curing me up nicely. Hearing reviews saying it's too green so I'm glad I sat on my can for a month. It's perfect now.Sep 05, 2020"

L -- Very hazy amber orange body with a small layer of fine white foam that actually retains fairly well.

S -- Somewhat hard to pick out the nuances because Trillium is currently serving in single-use cups. Orange creamsicle, weedy dankness, dried leaves, mango

T -- Tootsie roll, syrupy dank hop candy, green onion, citrus pith, bit of green yeasty character on the back end

F -- A bit chalky and syrupy. Big mouthfeel, medium- carb

O -- Eh, another TIPA that smells good but kinda loses it in the flavors/mouthfeel

Brilliant marigold haze on the pour, capped by a stunning billowy white head that sticks around longer than J Lo's a$$ when she's leaving the room. Aromas of creamy mango custard, a light herbal effervescence, and subtle notes of tropical fruit. Taste follows with a battle for superiority between lemon curd, mango lassi, and pineapple. There's a touch of heat on the back end, but it does not diminish or overwhelm the palate. Soft, chewy, and fully mouthcoating, this beer seduces you with each sip taken. The hype on this one is realer than real. If you're fortunate to get a can, pinch yourself. Hip Hop, you're the love of my life.Aug 05, 2020"

Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, some heat from the alcohol

Palate follows the nose, some hot peppers spice on the back end, lingering oak, bourbon

Relatively smooth but much thinner than expected.

The lack of carbonation isn't doing this any favors, guessing I'm missing out on the intended experience.Apr 02, 2021"

Consumed 4/12/20



I’ve been waiting to have this guy for awhile as Bomb is one of my first strong stouts that I’ve ever loved. Some other Prairie stouts can have too many adjuncts for me to really love, but I’m hoping BA Bomb hits the ride balance. First thing I notice is that it seems thinner than other Prairie stouts I’m used to. There’s very little carbonation too, even for a stout. I wonder if the age has something to do with that. Some lacing does stay though after the pour. On the nose I am not getting a lot of barrel but some spice like a regular bomb. I taste a bit of the pepper but not a lot. I think that’s usually what goes after aging. It’s sweet but not overly so. There’s barrel flavor too. Chocolate and vanilla notes a prominent. The beer is great but I wish I had it fresh. I think the aging has muted some of the best components of the beer. The barrel is perfect though. Great beer and worth seeking out!Apr 13, 2020"

4.04/5  rDev -9.8%
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 412oz bottle poured into a snifter. No date on the bottle, but I know it is at least a few years old at this point.



A: Black pour. A little bit of a beige head struggles to form and ultimately fails. Little to no lacing. Not all that concerning for a barrel aged beer of its strength.



S: The chiles are much more forward on the nose than expected, and that’s the first whiff emanating from the glass. Heavy dose of roasty coffee next, followed by a fat fudgey chocolate smell. Chocolate sauce and German chocolate cake. Roasted malt. Oak and whiskey come out more as it warms. 



T: In taste, it’s the massive tide of chocolate that hits first. Tons of hot fudge sauce, chocolate truffles, German chocolate cake, fatty nibs, etc. Lots of vanilla too, mingling for a malted milkshake impression. Nutty and roasty coffee brings in a mocha flavor. Lots of whole chile taste too. The heat is extremely mild, but the flavor is big and rides to the forefront for a bit. Oak and whiskey are actually the quietest component, surprisingly, but that sweet whiskey flavor does round things out nicely. Smokey coffee and a tingle of chile heat on the finish.



M: Rich in body with a bit of heft. Chewy and mouth-coating. Velvety. Low and gentle carbonation. 



O: A bombastic beer overall, and a bit of a roller coaster ride. Rather than melding into a cohesive whole, each ingredient basically takes a turn reaching out and slapping you right in the palate. It’s big, sweet, and straightforward. Even a little busy, if I’m being honest. That’s not to say it isn’t good- on the contrary, I really did enjoy it. If you’re a person who likes a nice “pastry stout,” you’ll likely love it. I think it’s a solid enough beer, but its brutish approach and bold, hedonistic flavors that vie for attention rather than coalescing can’t touch the more carefully composed and elite barrel-aged stouts. Very good, but not great.Apr 06, 2020"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good after an aggressive pour. Aroma is big. Apple brandy, toffee, barrel, char, and caramel dance and play over roasty and toasty malts. Flavor profile is medium-thin. Roasty and toasty malts lead the charge. Toffee, caramel, molasses, and apple brandy tag on for a flavorful brew. Mouth feel is velvety, and soft, but never hits creamy. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, solid stout with hints of apple brandy coming through.

I got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because I love Prairie and I knew people flip for this beer. Upon opening it, the smell is very distinct and I just don't like it! It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too. A great beer that changed my mind. I've never had a beer with a smell that I didn't like end up being enjoyable before, so a really fun beer.Dec 29, 2020"

T: Dry flowery hopping, citrus, and orange grind with a bready malting. 



M: Bready malty consistency for mouthful.

I enjoy Toppling Goliath Beers, I have yet to try their darker beers. The best by date is in a week, I need to get this one gone. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a bright white foamy and airy two-fingered head. The dissipation of the head left abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale straw, with golden hues. The beer is mostly clear with some haziness lurking within. The appearance of the beer is elegant. 



The initial aromas in the beer are pine needles, grapefruit rind, floral esters, and herbal. Nosing further in the glass, I detect toasted bread crust, lightly toasted malts, oranges, lemons, papaya, and a touch of solvent. 



The flavors in the beer are grapefruit, oranges, melons, lemons, guava, pineapple, herbal, floral esters, bready, lightly toasted malts, pine needles, phenols, wet grass, and peaches. 



The mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, astringent, and crisp. 



The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonations, and a fuller finish. 



The one thing that is off-putting in this beer is the carbonation, it is strong, bubbly. The flavors of the hops are wonderful but bitter with a steady malt backbone. A pleasant DIPA, not sure it is worth the high score that it has. I have better DIPAs with the harmony finessed.Apr 14, 2021"

S: Earthy papaya, and greener aromas such as green papaya and underripe pineapple. Both piney and peppery.



T: Still insanely bitter on the palate, but the other flavors are quite soft in contrast. And wow that bitter dryness goes on and on. I do like it though. Most would not pound this back - it's a sipper.



F: Smooth and mostly dry. Medium weight and decent carbonation.

Nose is dank, juicy, and hempy, even nearly two months. out. Tropical fruit, mango juice. Thyme, pine, poultry spices. Only the smallest hint of rawness from the hops deep in the nose. The taste is more subdued than the powerful nose; slight oily, spicy, resinous, and bitter notes throughout, even numbing like a sichuan peppercorn. Moderate juicy sweetness, but the hop spiciness is strong enough to prevent it from taking a leading role. Mouthfeel is typical - round and soft, light carbonation. I was more impressed with the aroma than the taste, but its spiciness was enjoyable.Feb 14, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.522 oz bomber (2015)



A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout. 



S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact. 



T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal. 



M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well. 



O - For whatever reason, I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. However, it has held up remarkably well in that time. I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. On its own, it's a delicious beer.Feb 07, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75I received a can from @FBarber in a BIF. Canned on 1/29/2020. Poured into a snulip glass. I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring, then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. It pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly, a sign of the alcohol content. Lots of raisin on the nose, along with roasted malt, chocolate, a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee, and earthy charred nuts. You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. This is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over, as well. There are also notes of caramel and earthy char, and the caliente pepper adds heat. The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV. The 12 oz. format is appropriate. Overall, this is a superb example of RIS - my favorite style, and it richly deserves its World-Class rating. I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit.Apr 19, 2020"

Smell - Chocolate, bourbon, with underlying notes of cinnamon and vanilla and subtle chiles.

Taste - An almost perfect blending of Mexican chocolate and bourbon. The chiles were quite noticeable, but did not overwhelm in terms of flavor or heat. The same can be said of the bourbon. 

Feel - Mouthfeel was a touch thin on the palate but enjoyable.

Overall - The aroma and flavors were so big and well balanced that I found myself focusing almost purely on those aspects. I would have enjoyed a bit more body on the palate, but that in no way detracted from my enjoyment. This is among the best beers I've had to employ chile peppers.Apr 19, 2020"

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a thin half finger of khaki head that recedes quickly, yielding no film nor any lacing. The aroma is pleasant, tons of fudge and chocolate, light pepper heat, tons of cinnamon, modest barrel, a nice oakiness with a good char and a bit of vanilla. The flavors are good, tons of chocolate, brownie batter and fudge but also a nice bitterness, dry cinnamon, light pepper heat with a super smooth bourbon character, lightly charred oak, modest roast with nice hearty grains and a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is good, thick and heavy, chewy but smooth and it coats very well with a warm but creamy finish.



Verdict: A very nice adjunct forward barrel aged stout from Spiteful. A great chocolate forward experience that is well balanced and accentuated by the cinnamon and pepper interplay while the vanilla tames the barrel, which isn't too hot and offers even more nuanced character.Feb 16, 2020"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4Black with a slow to build fizzy tan blanket that dies off quickly.



Smell is nutty roast and dry wafer with moderately spicy cinnamon and slightly astringent but fruity and popping chili pepper.



Taste has more depth yet is also refreshing, with just the right amount of warming pepper that is both mildly spicy and sweetly fruity. Cinnamon is lightly dusty and complements the roast of the moderately light-bodied stout. There's a touch of nutty cocoa but not a whole heckuva lot. The carbonation is crisp and lifting for a big stout, with tightly compacted bubbles finishing perfectly semi-dry.



This is like an older school, more drinkable stout with a lighter body and flavorings that don't overpower. Additionally--a shocking note for this day and age--it's not cloying. The only thing I'm not really experiencing here is any barrel. Not even a boozy heat.Jan 11, 2019"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer poured a hazy golden color with a white head. 



Smell - Hops were noted, with the presence of citrus and bitterness. 



Taste - The overall profile was dank. It was oily with a nice level of bitterness. The profile of citrus fruits were noted. Even though it was on the heavier side, it could make for a nice easy drinking.



Mouthfeel - Carbonation was appropriate, even with a thicker viscosity.



Overall - even though some might see this as a lighter beer, the taste comes with a heavier pprofile.Dec 20, 2021"

The nose is large and overpowering in a good way - prepping your tastebuds. Spicy, piney, earthen, skunky weed and tropical fruit notes.

The patience is rewarded with complex resin hop notes - fresh hoppiness, dried hoppiness fully crushing on the palate. All those nose notes are there but dare I say the aroma outweighs the taste. Finishes will a touch of malt and some bitterness.May 13, 2021"

S: Pine, grapefruit, mango, and citrus pith hop aroma. Big peach esters. Also a fairly substantial candied malt character for the style.



T: Big pine resin, grapefruit, and mango/pineapple flavors. Substantial bready caramel malt balance. The bitterness is firm but never dominates.



F: Medium/light bodied, very dry, crisp finish.



Overall: I was really impressed with this one. I honestly prefer it to Heady, which is saying a lot. I cannot recommend this on enough.Nov 07, 2020"

Pours opaque black with a half inch head of brown. Malted milk balls with dark chocolate and cocoa-dusted espresso beans in the nose. Full bodied with a crushed velvet mouthfeel.

3.4/5  rDev -24.3%
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 316oz can poured into a snifter.



A: Black on the pour with two fingers of brown head. Retention is good, lacing manifests in broken rings.



S: Nose is heavy on the chocolate. Brownie batter and a generous helping of Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Fatty nibs. Bit of woody roast and earthy hop. Berry-like fruity note. Nutty coffee.



T: Follows the nose. Chocolate all over the attack. Cocoa nibs, brownie batter, chocolate syrup in a big way. Sugary lactose. That berry fruitiness comes through tasting like a raspberry tootsie pop. Pervasive background flavor of nutty coffee. Quick flash of earthy hops, and woody and roasty malt flavors poke through now and again. Perhaps some subtle cola. Roasty and Chocolatey finish. 



M: Rich and thick in the mouth. Coating and almost syrupy. Tons of residual sugar. Carbonation is ample but gentle, and fluffs things up a little.



O: Might be an unpopular opinion, but this is just too sweet for me. Tree House has a penchant for taking all of their dark beers well onto the sweet side of things, and some fare better there than others. Here there is just not quite enough hop, coffee, or black malt bitterness to bring it into any semblance of balance. It does finish drier than it starts, but it isn’t nearly enough to save the drinkability. You gotta have a serious sweet tooth to enjoy beers like this, and unfortunately I find that I tend to favor balance and dryness as opposed to a candy-bomb like this. It tastes like chocolate syrup and sits like 16oz of chocolate syrup in the stomach. Looks like sweet sells though, so maybe I’m just an old grouch now.Sep 06, 2020"

Pours a thick oily black body with a dark brown head that sticks around for a while and leaves spotty lacing.



Holy crap this smells unreal. Straight peanut butter chocolate fudge cookies straight out of the oven with extra vanilla extract in them and a touch of coffee. Marshmallow s’mores ice cream galore. Bourbon booziness in the background. Pastry city. 



Taste is liquid Reese’s cups with dark chocolate fudge drizzled over them. Vanilla bourbon on the follow through, roasty coffee char on the finish. Thick rich body.



I am a sucker for a good pastry stout, and peanut butter cups. And this is the epitome of both.Mar 30, 2018"

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Darkness (2020) from Surly Brewing, Gorgon label with black wax. Picked up at Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA. $ 18.00 (Including tax)/22 oz bottle ($ 0.819/oz) on 18/09/21. On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 09/07/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.

Stamped on shoulder of bottle in nearly invisible ink “BOTTLED ON 09/08/20”. Served at 58.6 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 65.6 degrees. 

Appearance – 3.75.

First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), muddy. 

Body – Brown (SRM 30), opaque. When rear-lite, limited penetration but deep amber at the edges.

Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), initially brown sugar but lightening to fawn as it breathes, high-density, good retention, diminishing to a 0.3 to 0.5 cm crown and complete, rocky cap. As the head retracts, multiple partial and complete rings of tiny to small bubbles remain.

Lacing – Good. As the level drops, a wide band of tiny to small bubbles grows, separated from the above band by tiny stalactites and stalagmites. See also above.

Aroma – 4 – Moderate fruity malt and chocolate. No hops, no yeast.

Flavor – 4.75 – Begins markedly bitter with malt, although this bitterness ameliorates as it breathes. Seems pretty straightforward in taste – malt, a little chocolate, no dark fruit, no char, no coffee. No ethanol (12 % ABV, according to BA, NOT marked on label) aroma or taste. Good gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with hops predominating.

Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.

Final impression and summation: 4.25 Looks like pretty much every Impy stout and RIS on the market. Both the aroma and flavor are uncomplex and good – malt and chocolate – with only a small taste of organic acids edging in at the aftertaste but not pushing out the hops. The hoppy ending is unexpected and excellent!Jul 09, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.52020 release. Poured from undated bottle into a pint glass. It pours a dark mahogany with a full finger of luxurious, creamy, light mocha head and very thick lacing. It's a great looking pour. On the nose there is rich chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel/toffee, roasted nuts, leather, tobacco smoke, and char. The taste opens with lots of chocolate, toffee, raisins, and black cherry, along with strong coffee, dark chocolate, and dry barley. The fruit influence is stronger than I anticipated but welcome. It's also more bitter and hoppy than expected. The Amarillo and Simcoe adds a different dimension. The balance of sweet and bitter is terrific. Its mouth feel is creamy but not as thick and chewy as other big Russian Imperial Stouts. The carbonation is appropriate and the 12% ABV is warming. Overall, Darkness is an extremely well crafted RIS and deserves its World-Class rating.May 01, 2022"

Opaque in the glass, nice 2 fingers of head. 



Aroma of dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, sambuca, molasses, sweet dark fruits. 



Velvety smooth in the mouth, has a good amount of weight to it as well.



Tastes just as it smells, this is Russian Imperial Stout decadence here. Dark chocolate present throughout the palate, the molasses and sambuca are more mid palate, and the sweet finish of dark cherries and currants are a lingering treat in the finish along with that dark roasted malt. 



Aging for over 5 years likely softened any alcohol heat and made for a delicious and decadent stout that does not disappoint, even with sky high expectations going in. I also have a 2020 bottle I will be comparing it to soon.Jan 24, 2022"

APPEARANCE

Pitch black body and a hefty three fingers of fluffy, tan-colored head



AROMA

An onslaught of leather, coffee, black licorice, tobacco, char, cherries. I mean, it goes down the list of everything you want in a superior RIS.



TASTE

Dark chocolate bomb with all of the aforementioned RIS accoutrement (fancy word) from the aroma. Most prominent is the black coffee and cherries. A finish of tobacco and smoke is blowing wind up my dress and a lingering hop bitterness has my leg shaking reminiscent of a dog getting a belly rub.



MOUTHFEEL

Smooth and velvety. There is no alcohol taste on this big bastard, but a noticeable warmth is prevalent on each sip.



OVERALL

World Class RIS. I am no stranger to Surly Darkness and will never pass up a chance to have this.Jan 03, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.52021 edition. In the glass it looks almost black, but on the pour it looks a deep ruby red dark brown as light passes through. Quite pretty to watch. There is an inch plus of dense, brown foam falls to a substantial layer of bubbly goodness that laces incredibly.



The smell is rich, dark malt and more rich, dark malt. As it comes to life with warming, noticeable alcohol, coffee, baking chocolate, a dried fruit like dates and figs with some cherry. I think a slight caramel or brown sugar note creeps in.



The taste...holy mother of dark malty goodness! The promise of the aroma is delivered by the boatload. Waves of malt, the chocolate melds with the caramel/sugary and fruit notes, a mild coffee flashes by, and it becomes almost like fudge. The malt rules but doesn't overpower. Just when you think it's done, a strong bitter hit wakes you up along with a smack of booze for good measure. A very mild charred taste creeps in, but it is not overly strong.



The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, but not overly thick - luxurious and indulgent. Carbonation is tame as it should be. The quick but strong bitter hit and alcohol tingle remind you this isn't a lightweight.



Overall...I might have to go on the hunt to find more of this. I suspect it will age incredibly well. Outstanding in every way, this beer has everything and RIS should have and nothing it shouldn't - as worthy a brew as you can find.Jan 03, 2022"

Poured aggressively into a Snörkel tulip glass.

Thick head of tiny dark tan bubbles that dissipated to a thin cap. No lacing left in the glass.



Aroma of dark roasted malts, burnt coffee beans, raisins and char.



Taste is an abundance of dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter cacao and black cherries. Help up surprisingly well after 5 years!



Mouthfeel is heavy and full of tongue coating malts. Carbonation seems to be light, but could be due to age, not a negative. Not Eben a hint of double digit abv.



Overall, there's a reason why this is so highly rated. It's a winner through and through, even after sitting for 5 years waiting. Strong RIS, not to be taken lightly.Jan 03, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Really quite incredible head production, retention, and lacing given the ABV. Head is dark beige, not quite dark brown; body is an ebon hue befitting the name.



Impressively roasty aroma, along with a healthy dose of hops. Red grape, toast, moderate char, prune, dark bread, cola. It's dark, over the top, impressive, and incredibly inviting.



Thick and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on chewy. Fantastic. It feels every bit of the 12% ABV, but without harshness. It's bold enough to scare away the weak-willed, but smooth enough to reward the bold.



It's a bit of a throwback RIS on the palate: hoppy, charred, roasty, and very, very strong. Tons of dark fruit and dark bread, along with red grapes, caramel, toffee, chocolate, espresso, leather.



This is nothing less than a fantastic RIS, fully worthy of its lofty standing and rating.Jan 03, 2022"

Aroma is huge roasted malt notes, rich chocolate and coffee smooth and sweet with dark fruit notes, vanilla almost like cherry vanilla coke notes. All this is blended together in harmony.



Taste is like the nose rich and smooth big roasted notes. Loads of chocolate smooth and sweet but also some roasted coffee bitterness mingled with dark fruits. Hops keep it from cloying but don't really pick up bitterness except for the roasted bitterness. Finish is smooth and delicious lingering chocolate and roasted malts with the cherry vanilla coke notes.



Mouthfeel is big and smooth a creamy treat. Smooth mellow carbonation.

Poured out dark brown and settles like a dark night. A 1 and half inch head forms and settles into 1/4 inch light brown that does not go away.

Thin, light brown head. Darkest of chestnut color, with no sign of light through glass. A bit sweet, bourbonized toffee aroma, with a touch of spiced woodiness.

4.35/5  rDev -3.1%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Poured at fridge temp, but allowed to warm over a while. Pours straight black with a little bit of tan head. No bubbles apparent.



On the nose, I immediately get the tequila barrel. Chocolate, brandy, toffee, a bit of black licorice, and a bit of roasted malts.



The taste is liquid gold. Lots of black licorice right away. Some charred wood on the back end. Some nice dark chocolate in the middle. Dark fruit coming through as well. Cherries and blackberries. Brown sugar and vanilla starts to come out as well. Some dark German bread. Really nice flavor.



Mouthfeel is pretty thick, but not syrupy. Overall, a lovely stout.Jan 24, 2022"

Appearance: Black (only appears very dark brown at the edges if held up to a light) with a medium sized dark beige head which stuck around for a while.



Smell: Moderate Bourbon, brown sugar, mild vanilla and perhaps the faintest hint of tequila. A nice smelling IS.



Taste: Fairly prominent Bourbon, mild tequila notes, brown sugar, chocolate, and roast malt notes. The beer is mildly sweet, but the tequila notes and tannic oak notes help the beer finish fairly dry with just a hint of sweetness. Subdued alcohol presence for the ABV.



Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.



Overall: A good bal-aged beer from Firestone Walker. The tequila and bourbon bal-aging work well together in the flavor profile. This one is a keeper for sure.Dec 28, 2021"

4.14/5  rDev -7.8%
look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4There's been a weird undercurrent the last few years that 'there aren't good tequila aged beers'. This, central waters and fiftyfifty often come to mind when I hear that aforementioned incorrect opinion. Had this at the very first Firestone Walker Invitational. Quite the nice find. Did they also bring it to the Bistro's barrel aged festival a few years ago? I dunno, you always remember the first and then after that its like ""meh"". 



Anyways, pours black, had a very thin head on tap. Aroma gave off a nice mild tequila and wood presence, I thought it was cool. The taste took on a smooth, sweet tequila and low roast low bitterness kind of stout beers. A mix of different mild sweeteners, brown sugar, agave, vanilla = smoov just doin' his thang. Its a rather creamy beer that doesn't get bogged down in being oversweetened, fully hits the sweet spot but doesn't go beyond. 



Its pretty good stuff and I could easily see dropping a nice penny to have this again. Its unique and very good.Jan 01, 2019"

Would have loved to do a side by side with the Casey Jammy. 



Looks spectacular with great head retention. 

Smells like a handful of blackberries.

Tastes as the name denotes, blackberry jam, with some funk and oak along side. Not too tart.

Lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. Crenelated, nearly rocky lacing; superior retention. 



Lemon curd, wildflowers, hay, and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well. 



Brett. forward on the palate, tart, funky, and gently peppery. Unripe pears, meyer lemon, and some minerality. Low bitterness, moderate sourness. More fruit than phenols. Finishes fairly dry with some residual ""wild"" elements. Flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.



Medium bodied, soft, well carbonated. Refreshing yet satisfying.



Well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. Better with food, as the ale's flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with.May 22, 2022"

Tally ho! I feel like Errol Flynn in “The Seahawk” while drinking this thing. Just wow. It’s as if nothing can stop me and that I could have it all.

Pours a barely translucent dark honey-gold body capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a craggy sliver of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a haphazard spatter of spotty/webby lacing dotted across the walls of the glass.



Aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active, oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit.



Taste shows evenly dispersed lactic funk in the backdrop against a predominant waxy tropical fruit overlay lingering across the palate, with zesty lemon and oak barrel to an interlude of musty white wine tannins and a grassy back end; shades of barnyard with waxy white grape funk persist as lemon zest remains through the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample, fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick, oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate, mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end, leaving a predominantly clean, activated finish.



A bright, funky peak reached casually and with an almost unflinching consistency, the oak is a subtle background contributor interwoven with the bacterial evolution of a ripe tannic structure; bold and unwaveringly dynamic.Jan 01, 2022"

Smell - The nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent. 



Taste - My initial impression was the taste of green apples. The sour impression fit the green apple notes. The saison aspects produced a vinegary funk. Any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish. 



Mouthfeel - The carbonation gave influence to the dry finish. 



Overall - This is pretty much everything I want in a saison. I don’t need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty.Jan 01, 2022"

Appearance: A hazy golden colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass, while leaving some lacing.



Aroma: Funky, barnyard, minerals, light tartness, tropical stone fruit, apricot, unripe berries, green apple, citrus, grapefruit, lemon peel, oak, a touch of grains, with slight pepper notes.



Taste: Tart, tropical and citrus fruity, grapefruit, apricot, green apple, light funk, oak, vinous, with a lightly spicy finish.



Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.



Overall: Unfortunately, I haven’t had the opportunity to try it fresh, but this bottle having aged 6 / 7 years, has aged gracefully with wonderful complex yet balanced aroma and flavours.Aug 26, 2021"

A little lemon and mixed fruit, clear wood, a hint of must and some pepper in the very enticing aroma.



Sour lemon again up front in the taste. Certainly tart, but without being an enamel stripper. Balanced somewhat by the strong wood, a little funk and again just a hint of mixed fruit sweetness. Maybe a little mineral water or clay in the finish.



Very soft feel. A touch more heft than expected. Soft, tickley carbonation.



A beautifully crafted beer from start to finish. A little more robust than some super refined beers, while still managing to expertly balance the sourness, tartness, funk and wood. A real treat.Jul 09, 2021"

A clear golden yellow with a dense white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is pretty excellent, a soft, bright tartness,with notes of key lime, lemon, a light, lightly toasted French oak note, mildly vinous and fruity. There's a little grape, and a real nice Brett expression, lightly spicy with a little clove and pepper and a touch of pineapple juice to go with a mild floral honey note. Really nice depth and structure. 



The palate opens tart with a nice blend of lactic and lemon acidity along with a really nice Brett funk. The lactic acidity is sharp but fleeting, priming the palate for the fruit that follows. Delicate pineapple, grape, peach and honey are present. Minimal straw notes. The Brett expression is restrained but thoughtfully executed, pairing nicely with the oak notes, tannins, light vanillin and almost vinous notes. Drying, mildly tannic and earthy on the finish, long lasting with firm acidity. Light in body, crisply carbonated, nicely structured. Impressive.Dec 26, 2020"

Look: Pours pitch black with a full but patchy dark brown head that dissipates quickly. A lot of very fine floaters visible.



Smell: Peanut butter and milk chocolate combined with some roasty hints. Almonds and tobacco appear as the beer warms.



Taste: Peanuts, chocolate and coffee. Slightly sweet, somehow roasty and minimally bitter.



Feel: Creamy and oily with a clearly present carbonation. Quite smooth.



Overall: No barrel-aging, no double digit ABV, but still a fantastic stout with a classic flavor combination. All flavors are incorporated very nicely resulting in a great balance and a smooth drinkability. There are plenty of chocolaty peanut butter stouts out there but this is clearly the best one I‘ve had so far.Jun 17, 2022"

Chocolate malts, lactose, Cocoa, and a bit of dry roasted peanuts. I’m not a huge fan of lactose in general, but here it does ok. Well carbonated and creamy. Overall really tasty, but not mind blowing in any way. I would definitely buy it regularly if it was available in my area.May 09, 2022"

Aroma and flavor feature dark chocolate, creamy peanut butter, dark roasted malts, bitter coffee, vanilla, and some earthy hop presence. This has to be the perfect peanut butter cup beer: not too sweet, real peanut butter flavor, not too strong abv-wise. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and not boozy. Overall it's a shockingly good beer and a real treat to drink.Apr 29, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.2516oz can received as a gift from a friend. Indicates YEAR THREE on the can with a date of 1/7/22, so this is being consumed at just after 3 months.



Look: Pours out very dark brown almost black with a deep brown colored, frothy head. The head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a thin layer behind. Looks stunning.



Smell: The aroma is wonderful. This smells like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup. Notes of roasted hazelnuts and charcoally coffee also. There's even a subtle green bell pepper and licorice aroma on the finish, which is very interesting for a milk stout.



Taste: Interesting. It is much sweeter than I was expecting. And that's appropriate, because this is a milk stout. I think it's just that from the nose, I expected it to be not as sweet as it is. The mouth mirrors the nose, but perhaps the peanut butter flavor on the palate is much more subtle than in the aroma. Also, a lot of the sweetness is perceived to have an artificial sweetener vibe that is less than ideal for me. The finish is long and has a nice roasty, charcoally chocolate/coffee flavor.



Feel: Mouthfeel is relatively thick. This is smooth and chewy. Carbonation is spot on. Really nice.



Overall: This is my first Tree House beer that was not a New England IPA. This beer reminds me a lot of another peanut butter milk stout that I enjoyed: Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing. One of the differences is that Gunner's Daughter does not have coffee and that Hold On To Sunshine is higher ABV. Overall, this is a really great coffee milk stout. It was hard to choose between a 4.25 and 4.5 overall; in the end, I gave it a 4.25 because the artificial sweetener taste knocks it down slightly for me.Apr 08, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.516 ounce can in a tulip stout glass. Exactly 30 days since canned.



Opaque black crude oil color with a near 3f dark tan cap. A ring remains and leaves splashes of lacing. A beauty.



Smoky roasted malt aroma with peanut butter, chocolate, and fresh roasted coffee.



It tastes like a peanut butter, chocolate, and roasted coffee mix over a campfire. Nice.



Palate friendly full body and flavors. No sign of its 7.6% abv. Very rich and roasted.



Before opening, I let this sit for an hour after removing from the fridge. The temperature enhanced its aroma and feel. Rich and creamy peanuts and chocolate. Not built for every day drinking but so good.Dec 14, 2021"

4.46/5  rDev -2.2%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Had on tap. Jet black viscous body with a tiny tan foam ring. Smell has strong strawberry and vanilla with supporting chocolate, bourbon and marshmallow. Taste really does capture the creamy flavoring of neapolitan ice cream with the strawberry and vanilla intermingling with the base chocolate BA stout, has supporting wood and bourbon heat from barrel on the finish. My one qualm is when it warms the strawberry starts to taste like mentos and dominate more. Feel is cool, smooth, thick, sticky, and has kisses of booze heat, but as it warms it start to get a little more astringent.Nov 05, 2019"

4.62/5  rDev +1.3%
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Glossy black with a thin dark tan head settling to a persistent ring.



The first sip comes with two competing forces of marshmallow and spicy barrel. The barrel almost has a cinnamon hint to it at first, but not quite. Then creamy strawberry glides in, and is just present enough to help develop that distinct Neapolitan flavor. It's fresh, seedy and mildly fruity, while the base stout is chocolatey.



The medium-light body has a crackly carbonation and finishes semi-dry. A mild but complex and mature barrel heat brings peppery char and caramel. As it warms, licorice, date, nougat and fudge massage the palate further into a pastry coma. It's absolutely delicious and delectable, but much easier drinking than all this decadence might sound.Jun 24, 2019"

4.39/5  rDev -2.2%
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Hazed golden straw with a finger-and-a-half of near-white foam head with tightly knit bubbles. Some modest, sloppy lacing clings to the sides of the glass before sliding back down into the crown and wisp.



Refined barnyard aroma with hints of hay, lemon and apricot fruit roll-ups.



Delightful taste of super-juicy dried apricot layered over a slightly sour, slightly funky barnyard-and-lemon base. There’s maybe a little white wine. Maybe a little oak. The tartness and acidity comes in on the backend, and is somewhat lighter than I expected. Really superb.



Soft, mildly creamy mouthfeel with tight carbonation.



One of the juiciest, softest-feeling sours I’ve had the pleasure of drinking. The acidity really isn’t over the top at all. I love this.Dec 20, 2019"

Pours an oily midnight-black body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a paper-thin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass.



Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant, nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory, tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close.



Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish.



Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation, purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded, sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish.



An honest, old-school display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity, composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings, this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure.Jan 30, 2022"

75th unique beer from Hill Farmstead.



bottled on date is Jan 10, 2020.



Appearance: black bodied stout. 1-2 fingers tall; medium brown head. Big loose bubbles break the head down into a thin cap that drops down to an uneven ring. Booze legs with each sip. spotty lacing on the side of the glass.



Smell: While taking the wax off the bottle, I could immediately smell bourbon! Nice bourbon note and heavy barrel char once poured into the glass. Chocolate and smoke. 



Taste: Bourbon leads this beer with a nice sweetness and the bourbon is also lightly spicy. Dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, & moderately roasty malt profile. Tobacco and leather. Smoke, peat moss, and ashen barrel char begin to build after each consecutive sip; deep earthy and woody character as well. Umami richness in the middle of the stout. Light oxidation notes in the form of soy sauce; it's very faint and does not distract from anything here. Meaty smoke and peat moss finish that lingers for a little while after each sip. Unique flavors here that I don't taste very often in barrel aged stouts; it's rich with mature barrel notes without being overly sweet. Complex. Interesting. Well done bourbon barrel aged stout by Hill Farmstead.



Mouthfeel: Medium bodied stout. Low and adequate carbonation levels. Creamy carbonation. Smooth and rich texture. It's not motor oil and its really great exactly where it is... in regards to this stout's texture. Damon is not at all boozy, but it does have a noticeable warming presence. This stout actually drinks heftier than the 10.5% abv & I do not mean this in a bad way at all. It's a really robust bourbon barrel aged stout and the texture lends itself to this without being abrasive at all. The beer remains smooth from fridge temperature all the way to room temperature. I solo domed this bottle and drank it over the course of two hours, it retained smooth sipping status the entire time. 



Overall: Well, this beer has eluded me for a really long time. Really excited for the opportunity to finally get to drink it and see what it's all about. I got to try port Damon back in July of this year and I think that I prefer the port barrel version just a little bit more than the bourbon barrel. Hill Farmstead stouts always tend to distinguish themselves from the crowd. It shows that a stout does not need to be sweet to be rich especially when the stout has such great texture.Nov 03, 2021"

Note: April 2016 batch



Black with some deep, dark brown around the edges, opaque, pours with a small tan head, fades to virtually nothing (not shocking after 5 years)

Deep spectrum of chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet chocolate, brownies, chocolate cake, caramel, molasses, some dark fruit, nice balance with the bourbon, woody notes, oak, some vanilla, lingering sweetness balanced with some barrel dryness 

On the light side of heavy, smooth, low carbonation



I believe I have had this beer as many as 3 times since April 2016, but I never reviewed it. Better late than never, and I may never have this beer again. Shocking news: this is an amazing beverage.Apr 28, 2021"

Can to snifter.



Citrus nose. Grapefruit. Tangerine. Melon. Black pepper.



Pine taste. Some tangerine in finish.





Interesting.



Changing flavors and palates as it goes. A touch more juicy as it warms; also the aroma picks up more of the pepper and pine throughout.



Poor mans Julius.

Beer poured a hazy golden orange with a very nice white head with the original pour.



Nose is very nice as the citrus and tropical fruits are front and center.



Taste is spot on as the moderate sized pale malt base takes on a solid dose of orange, lemon, and mango wonderfully. Finishes with a nice rind bitterness; 6/10 on my scale.



Mouthfeel is light bodied and very refreshing.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Citraquench'l is a long-time whale. I bought two packs today in Durham, NC. canned on 7/1/2021. Poured into a pint glass. It pours an opaque, tangerine color with a half finger of foamy, milk-white head and thick, soapy lacing. Its smell features bright lemon, lime, grapefruit, tangerine, and some delightful, floral notes. Wow, the taste is something else! The Citra offers huge, sweet citrus: lemon, lime, orange, pineapple, and ripe honeydew melon. It just pops. It's amazing that all this flavor comes from a single hop. The mouth feel is moderately creamy with near perfect carbonation, and at 7.1% ABV it's readily drinkable. Overall, Citraquench'l is everything it purports to be and more! It's absolutely delicious. One of the best New England IPAs I've had the pleasure to drink. Just terrific!Jul 20, 2021"

4.55/5  rDev +0.9%
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours bright orange with a foggy transparency. Head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. A few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass, but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. The level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass- it develops a more murky appearance, with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is immediate peaches, but they're soft and delicate. It leans slightly into tart, but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. Faint cellar stone, oak, and grass occupy the rest of the nose, rounding out the depth. Peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish. Just like the nose, the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature, and with that, it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. Still no puckering sourness, but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. No puckering or tart finish, with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. It nearly falls flat on the tongue, with the initial portion being crisp. Overall, peach addition is wonderful, with the rest of the profile being a steadfast, focused, and balanced saison. It's not overly acidic or tart, providing just enough tartness to offer contrast, without forcing it into sour territory.

Deep yellow-orange (like a peach) color appearance with foam which quickly dissipates. This smells like peach already, but a lot of barnyard funk too in the aroma.

Having had a Framboise du Fermier earlier in the day, this has a relatively toastier sesame seed cracker malt and oak interplay that is likely assisted by not being anywhere nearly as sour. The frothy medium body is so much more balanced, with a just lightly tart herbal peach skin presence accented by a nutty funk.



This is actually delicate by comparison to FdF, and as such, so much more enjoyable. However, we also had a few de Garde brews before this, and the comparison to the kings of stone fruit out in the Pacific Northwest is a stark one, no matter how formidable the challenger.Jul 06, 2020"

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4Pours a clouded orange color with a medium, froth head.



Smells of riper peaches, old wood and bread dough among a lighter, stony pith quality. Got a lighter glue and blue cheese funkiness underneath, giving the fruit in this a nice little twist.



Drinks light, with an omnipresent acidity, balanced by a higher, refreshing carbonation.



Tastes of sun ripened peaches, not yet to the point of getting jammy though, due to a present acidic sourness, hitting the palate uncompromising. Turns a tad effervescent then, with a noteable mineralic note, wrapped up by older, oaken wood, adding a pleasant, funk accompanied complexity to the flavors. Finishes calmer, with maintaining sweet peaches, building a well working counterpart to the teeth numbing sourness in this, which the peaches manage to overcome during the aftertaste.



Very well rounded, fruited sour with a great balance to it, pushing successfully further than most other AWAs.Oct 27, 2019"

4.07/5  rDev -9.6%
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 42018 bottle, drank March 2021 out of an oversized tulip.



Look - poured with little head, quite dark and sludgy.



Smell - faint, maybe a little roasty.



Taste - a bit of coffee and dark chocolate but no coconut, the surprise was a chunk of something, must have been solidified coconut, that got trapped in my mouth and quickly dissolved. Nice taste, like it says on the bottle, like a chocolate cake, but I typically don’t like chocolate cake unless it’s tarted up with other stuff, and this was a straight chocolate cake taste. No alcohol or barrel to be found anywhere.



Feel - moderately thick.



Overall - a big let down for such an acclaimed beer. Firstly - I was most looking forward to that Bottle Logic Barrel and got none. Secondly, the chunk. Thirdly, the taste and smell didn’t jump out at me in any way. I mean, I didn’t NOT enjoy it, and it was cellared properly, but I’m just not feeling this one like other BLs.Mar 21, 2021"

This is a 2019 Vietnamese barrel aged version.

Quite, quite dark brown, with a thin beige head. No light transmission here. Sweet bourbon and molasses, with some toasted coconut and toffee, in the smell. Slightly syrupy malt, toasted coconut and a bit of spiced toffee, in the taste, with a tiny bite that lingers awhile. Finish is a sweet dark malt and bourbon flavor.Oct 25, 2021"

2019 vintage from pint growler filled at B&V. Poured into tulip glass. 



Same as prior but this time appearance was much better. Huge tan head, tons of thick lacing. Same great smell, taste and feel. About as close to perfect as I can imagine. 



Feb 2020 Review

2017 vintage from pint growler bottles at Barrels & Vines 18 months or so ago. Poured into a pint tulip glass. 



Basically the same review as in the past. This is an incredibly delicious candy bar masquerading as a beer. Appearance is probably the only weak point. Huge coconut, cinnamon, toffee, chocolate, bourbon nose and taste. ABV is well hidden; this one can get you into trouble. Super creamy moist. Still pretty much my favorite beer ever except for the high ABV and, now, taproom only distribution.



June 2018 Update

Had a 2017 vintage from a 16oz growler poured recently at Barrels & Vines. 



Very much the same as original review with cinnamon a bit more pronounced, slightly less alcohol but every bit as good as I remember. Maybe even creamier than I recal. A great beer. Have a few more 2017 in the cellar. Can’t wait! 

Didn’t get any 2018 as it was taproom only release which wasn’t practical for a SE MI beer lover.



2017 vintage (orange ball).

Pours a dark brown with a small head that took some work. Minimal lacing, low carbonation. 



Sweet smell with a delicious aroma I can't place. Maybe toasted coconut (which I don't normally like) with brown sugar. Definite booziness but very smooth nonetheless. 



Sweet right at the start but chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, other spices combine with bourbon and oak. One of the more complex and wonderful tastes I've experienced. Maybe a bit on the sweet and boozy side but I love it. Gets better as it warms. 



Mouthfeel is amazing. Substantial complexity with low carbonation that suits me just right. Like the taste, it gets better as it warms. 



Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a bit sweet but not overdone. The sugar and bourbon alcohol mix perfectly with chocolate, spice, vanilla and cinnamon.



Can't wait to age a bottle and drink another!Feb 23, 2020"

4.42/5  rDev -1.6%
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.252016 vintage with the Purple Bowling Ball on the label, it pours pitch black color with a small tan/mocha colored head that faded faster then normal and left minimal traces of lacing. Nose is full of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, dark fruits and chocolate milk. I didn’t detect any coconut but still found this to be very complex and enjoyable to inhale.



Flavor has a lot more dark fruit, toffee and sweetness to it like black cherry soda along with brown sugar and a melted Heath Bar. It almost borders on cloyingly sweet, but that aspect helps hide the 15% ABV. Like the nose I got of barrel or oaky notes, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, more dark fruits, cocoa powder, candy and chocolate milk. None of the coconut advertised on the bottle, but a dynamic profile that was a lot more balanced than I expected. A tad bit thin, even for a porter, and while it’s overall a very impressive brew it’s too sweet to drink a bomber by yourself as I struggled having it alone. A definite dessert beer to share with a few other beer lovers.Jan 12, 2020"

Intro: 750 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend 



Appearance: Dark virtually black color. Ample head, maybe 2 inches. Moderate lacing as we drank



Smell: Coffee in the foreground followed by chocolate and vanilla.



Taste: Followed along with the smell. Coffee is not overpowering. The chocolate lead up the flavor profile.



Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation.



Drink: Very well rounded. Very enjoyable.



Conclusion: Easy to see why this is one of the top American Imperial stouts. Was a very enjoyable experience. Would not hesitate to pick up more if it presented itself.Aug 28, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Brew: Bottle Logic Brewing – Leche Borracho



Intro: 500 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend. 



Appearance: Dark black color. Minimal head but some. Same with the lacing as we drank



Smell: Cinnamon up front followed closely with chili pepper, Bourbon brings up the back end.



Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Chili pepper is strong for my tastes.



Mouthfeel: Creamy but the chili holds that in check. Medium mouthfeel



Drink: Again, follows along with mouthfeel. I’ve had better and I’ve had much worse. It’s not my favorite selection from Bottle Logic



Conclusion: I’ve had several other Bottle Logic brews and this would not be in my top 4 or 5. It is mostly because of the chili pepper but that is personal taste. I am a big fan of the brewery, just not this particular beer. It’s still finely crafted and is deserving of the score givenJul 24, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Purchased for $20 from a private collector. 3 year old 500 ml bottle from 2018 poured into a snifter. This is my first Bottle Logic brew, as I'm in Ohio so it's difficult to get California beer out here. Poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle, then disappeared completely. The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer.Apr 25, 2021"

Pours a glossy jet-brown body with chocolate/chestnut hues and capped with two fingers of rich, light mocha foam; excellent head retention leaves a slim layer of frothy cap, a moderate, creamy collar, and a near-comprehensive coating of mounded, webby lacing caked across the walls of the glass.



Aroma features an extensive malt char deftly interwoven with lager yeast and toasty brown bread as tinges of beechwood smoke and bakers chocolate over the middle engage minerality into the back end and hints of coffee on the close.



Taste shows touches of leathery char and burnt coffee upfront, with added nuances of bakers chocolate against a rounded lager yeast and a touch of minerality over the mid-palate; malt roast grazes the back end, while brown bread crusts and nutty coffee grounds offer a subtle inflection on the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium body with a medium-full carbonation, a purely silky texture seeing a sinewy backbone weaving grit and char to pseudo-creamy sensations throughout the mid-palate toward a firm, drying, and persistently roasty back end to nimble harmony on the finish.



Lagery roast finds waves of smoke and silky chocolate undertones to fuse with an obsessive Hill Farmstead precision of texture, bringing the modesty of an American Porter to climax with detailed expression on an otherwise restrained medium.Jan 20, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Look: opaque, dark chestnut brown, bordering on black. Slightly viscous ringing when swirled; thick, tight carbonation.

Smell: lots of cocoa, coffee, toffee and brown sugar. 

Taste: absolutely incredible! Perfectly balanced with a nutty malt backbone that stops just short of drifting into stout territory. 

Feel: perfect body; thick but not chewy or overly sugary. Carbonation was on point and makes this eminently drinkable.

Overall: hands down one of the best--if not the best--porters I've had in a while. Would definitely seek this out as a winter-warmer, or after dinner drink. Best of all, the ABV is manageable and leaves room for another glass.Jan 09, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours jet black with a good amount of light brown head that sticks around for a while. Lacing is extensive. The nose is roasted malts, black licorice, milk chocolate, some coffee grounds, and a light tobacco note. Really smooth and nice. 



The taste is outstanding. Intense and complex. Dark chocolate, charred wood, malts, licorice, burnt toffee, dark roast coffee, and a bitter smoky flavor that becomes more intense on the aftertaste. Very smooth and well integrated. I really dig this one. Not surprised by the great ratings!



Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. There is a nice creaminess to it. Overall, this is a fantastic porter that I'm very glad to have tried.Dec 23, 2021"

Creamy, almost like milk, chocolate. Not very sweet though. No coffee. 



Smooth and silky mouthfeel. Lower carbonation. There's a bit more bitterness than the smell suggests but it seems to come from hops not black patent malt as there's no burnt elements of coffee flavors.

Hill Farmstead Brewery

Date: 18 May 2021

I nearly fell out of my chair when I discovered I was given this beer. Hill Farmstead is on my shortlist for must-visit breweries. They have several beers I want to consume. They have a best-by date to drink: furthermore, I am sure it is okay; it is only a couple weeks past. The beer was carefully maintained to preserve its integrity of the beer. I poured into a Willi Belcher glass; the temperature was 46 degrees. A frothy and creamy three-fingered dark tan head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 24, dark oily brown. The appearance of the beer is beautiful. 



Oh wow, the malty profile is vibrant and aromatic. I smell dark roasted malts, chocolate, medium roasted coffee, a hint of floral, leather, intense earthiness, and subtle char note. 



Coffee and chocolate smack your tastes buds in the sweet spot. Dark roasty malts, toast bread, a touch of floral, a dab of Maillard, a tinge of char, tobacco, leather, earthiness, and a slight herbal note is what I taste next. The beer is a parade of flavors doing a technical difficult choreograph dance with precision on your palate. 



The mouthfeel is a little bit bitter, with some creaminess followed by a skosh of dryness. 



The body is medium, medium carbonation, and has a long and delightful finish. 



One of the best porter I have ever consumed. It has all the great qualities of stout but in the porter style. I love the robust flavors and creaminess with the bitterness.Oct 10, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Everett from Hill Farmstead Brewing. Received in early June 2021 in Ninja box from @Roy_Hobbs. 16 oz can stored at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 1/7/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.

Bottom rim stamped “CANNED 05/18/21 DRINK BY 09/18/21”. Served at 53.0 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.6 degrees. 

Appearance – 4.5.

First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear. 

Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. When rear-lite, opaque but translucent amber brown at the edges.

Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), wheat, high density initially but quickly opening, average retention, diminishing to leave a 0.7 to 1.0 cm lacy crown and a thin complete cap. An archipelago of foam islands resembling coral atolls remains on the sides of the glass above the crown. Second pour produces a dense 0.7 cm head. 

Lacing – Fair. Wide band of tiny bubbles, separating into two bands, with short, blunt, stalactites. See also above.

Aroma – 4.25 – Begins with roasted malt and cocoa, no hops, no yeast, no coffee.

Flavor – 4.25 – Begins slightly sweet with roasted malt and cocoa and a hint of coffee, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. Slight gastric warming does occur. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends slightly bitter.

Palate – 4 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation. 

Final impression and summation: 4.25 Very velvety mouthfeel. The first few swallows went from slightly sweet to very bitter with alarming swiftness, but then it seemed to smooth out, just ending slightly bitter in counterpoint to the initial sweetness. Predominant taste and odor are roasted malt and cocoa, with just a hint of a smoky coffee on the tongue. In total, particularly good porter.Jul 01, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5I received a can of this famous Porter from @Roy_Hobbs. Canned on 5/18/2021. Poured at 59° into a Willi Becher pint glass. It pours nearly black with very dark cola hues at the bottom of the glass when held to the light, with a large, fluffy, medium khaki-colored had and thick creamy lacing. It's a beautiful pour. Its fragrant nose features dark chocolate, cigar smoke, burnt coffee grounds and charred nuts. Wow, the taste is amazing! The initial chocolate malt sweetness is juxtaposed to acidic coffee (like it's from a Jersey diner), and bitter, earthy, nutty char. There is also strong tobacco. The blend and balance of flavors are exquisite. The mouth feel is rich and creamy - almost stout-like - with mild carbonation, and the 7% ABV seems perfect. Everett is highly drinkable but with excellent substance. This Porter is big and flavorful enough to pair with a fine meal of roasted red meat but you could easily drink a couple of pours casually. Everett's 100 Score is well-deserved. It's as good an American Porter as you'll have the great pleasure of drinking.May 30, 2021"

Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass, this beer featured a hazy but bright apricot color with a big foamy white head. Head retention was excellent and there were thick bands of foamy lacing on the glass. Aroma was strong and pleasant, mostly floral, aromatic hops and sweet caramel malt. Flavor was more of the same but with great bitterness and piney hops overtaking floral hops. Great balance between the rich sweet malt and the strong piney bitterness. Outstanding flavor. Mouthfeel was rich like an American Barleywine with both sweetness and bitterness featured. A great sipping beer!!! One of the best beers I have had in a long time!!!Jun 10, 2022"

Appearance: Fairly cloudy amber color with generous-sized, thick, off-white head that slowly faded. Nothing to change here.



Smell: Moderate pine aromas and mild sweet fruity aromas. There is a bit of malty aromas also present.



Taste: Some sweetish malt notes first show up with some faint pine notes followed by a blast of hop bitterness. The beer has that sweet taste i typically get when IPAs/IIIPAs hit 10% or more ABV. The beer has a fairly sweet initial taste which dies off with some lingering bitter hop notes.



Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.



Overall: A good IIPA but too high in ABV for my personal tastes for an IPA/IIPA. I just find the malt sweetness a bit much in hop centric beers over 9.5% or so.Mar 12, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.5From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 10/04/21 Q0433""



Appearance: It has a murky orange and gold body with some shadows that are just barely visible through it. The head is large, thick, and white. The head has a consistency of whipped cream with tapioca-like bubbles. It has very good retention and lacing.



Aroma: There is a light floral aroma with what smells like a dusty orange hard candy. As a whole the aroma is pretty muted but ok.



Taste: The flavor kind-of mimics the aroma; up front there is this orange flavor which is slightly floral. Towards the middle it picks up a light pith character and a bit of sweet malt flavor. It finishes slightly floral.



Mouthfeel: Carbonation feels great. The beer has a medium-light pithy hop bitterness. The body is on the lower edge of medium and smooth. Drinkability is high.



Overall: The flavors and aromas seem good but they are a bit muted in the beer. The can states that this is a ""ALC 10.5% BY VOL"" and it does a phenomenal job of hiding the high alcohol content. The beer mostly tastes like a somewhat sweet orange hard candy which is interesting. It isn't the best example of an Imperial IPA but it is still worth drinking due to the high drinkability. I probably wouldn't drink it often but I wouldn't turn it down.Jan 30, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Picked this up at Hy-vee in Owatonna Minnesota. No canned on date. 

Appearance: Pours a golden yellow orange color and fairly opaque with some visible sediment. Almost 3 fingers of snow-white foam. Great head retention and lacing down the glass once the foam dissipates. 

Smell: Initial notes of pine and citrus including grapefruit and orange rind. Lighter melon notes are also present with tangerine and apricot. Caramel and cracker malts with a prevailing bitterness. As the beer warms grassy and flowery notes become more prominent as the beer warms with an accompanying dankness. 



Taste: Holy Hops! Bitterness jumps out the glass and assaults the tastebuds. On the back end there is a pronounced overwhelming sweetness that really destroys the complexities of the malt backbone. Its hard to make anything out besides pine and grapefruit in the first few sips. More citrus notes arise after the first few sips including orange, mango, guava, melon, and lemon. Earthy grassy and floral notes also become more pronounced along with a present dankness. Maybe a subtle amount of cracker and caramel malts present, but the malt character is underwhelming. 



Feel: Medium carbonation with enhances the bitterness. Mouth feel is thick and usually I wouldn’t associate juiciness and bitterness, but this beer seems to have both. Definite alcohol warmness and a bit of a boozy aftertaste as the beer warms. 



Overall: This beer is solid, very complex and a lot of good flavors, but the sweetness is a bit overwhelming and doesn’t allow for other complexities to show. Also pretty expensive at $14 for a 4-pack of tall boys. I don’t think I would buy it again, but if it was offered to me I wouldn't turn it down and I’m glad I tried it.Dec 23, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Received via NBS BIF #13 from @Jayorear.

Poured brown with tints of red, the beige head grew to about 1 cm and settled to a thin film leaving no lacing.

Aroma had red wine vinegar and, oddly, red wine (I mean, how do they get both of those aromas to come through?) 

The taste, wow. Oak, funky red wine vinegar and, at the edges, dry red wine. Faint but unmistakable. The flavors play off each other in every sip.

The feel is medium with very active carbonation. Fits well with the flavors.

Thanks Jay, this was amazing!Jul 10, 2022"

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Re-reviewing this one (7/1/2022) now that I have an additional decade of beer tasting experience (and, consequently, several additional pounds) under my belt.



375mL (bottled 7/12/2021) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber/mahogany with almost zero head, lazy carbonation rising from the bottom.



Aroma is acidic and vinous, tart and bright. Bready caramel malt, oak, apple cider vinegar. The yeast is clearly doing the heavy lifting here.



Taste is likewise sour and fruity with lots of red wine character. Oak barrel, wild yeast, clean malt, tannins. Complex and delicious. 



Mouthfeel is crisp and light, hiding the relatively high ABV. Finishes clean and dry, super refreshing. 



Overall an excellent, well constructed wild/sour ale. Seems pretty straightforward but it’s one of those beers that is deceptively simple. Clearly a great deal of skill and artistry went into producing this. It’s reputation is well deserved.

There’s a little fizz as I pour, but my attention quickly shifts to the eye catching dark amber liquid. It has a viscose appearance, bubbles move slower, like a hardening piece of amber, and there’s a notable lack of foam. 



It’s funky, naturally. Lacto sourness, copper, and the currants come through with their gamey, deep fruitiness. 



Moderate tartness before moving on to a schmorgasbord of funk, leather, barrel, dry red wine, and those delicious little berries. 



Light body, practically no carbonation, and just a little slick.

O: So this is my first time with any of the RR sours. Right away, I don't see too much as to why this is so special or a top 250 beer. I've had many sours and Cab-aged sours that are similar to this. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer. Very complex and deep and the barrel is done really nice. I can be maybe this being very pioneering back in the day, so maybe it's reputation precedes it. Just don't think in 2022 this can hold a candle to some of the wild ales from HF or SARA or even Bellwoods.



Recommendation: I mean, yeah, it's an RR sour from the -ation series, you gotta try it. Just don't go in expecting to get your mind blown. Hopefully the next two I have are better.May 05, 2022"

I’m back with my next Russian River Wild. I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it



Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing



Perhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather



Oh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla



A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10%



Well this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic. I could have a cellar full of this and be happy. Cheers yallMar 14, 2022"

A: Poured into a Russian River tion glass to a deep reddish brown beer which is topped by a dense bit of pinkish white head which fades to a collar around the edge of the glass

S: Smells of a really nice amount of tartness with some red wine vinegar notes, currants, and oak along with a touch of caramel.

T: Taste is red berries and currants with some nice acidity. Oak and red wine with some more berry fruitiness. On the swallow there's more red berries, currants, red wine, acidity and some lingering oak.

M: This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is on the low end with a somewhat syrupy feel while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.

O: Overall this is an outstanding dark sour. Really nice flavors and complexity with a really nice amount of acidity to really round things out. I wasn't sure how well this one would have held up but it's an incredible drinking experience.Nov 06, 2021"

Consecration

Russian River Brewing

Date: 05 November 2020

Another sour today, but this one is aged in wine barrels with currants. Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist. The beer is 48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present. 



The aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical. 



The flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky. 



The mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering



The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish. 



This sour is wonderful all the flavors in the beer create this harmonious blend of flavors. The wine barrel aging gave the beer depth and complexity. Stellar beer!Aug 28, 2021"

Corona Day #65



Price: $19.99 Lowry Hill Liquor in Minneapolis

Current Rank: #184 on Beer Advocate



Appearance: 4 - extremely black, and a bit thin. Head fizzled away immediately.



Nose: 5 - nearly all sweet barrel. Good!



Taste: 5 - basically all barrel. Fruitier than some other big stouts for sure. Reminds me a little of Surly Darkness, which can almost pass for a quad.



Mouth: 4 - thick and sticky, but quite flat. Glides down the throat smoothly, but I prefer more carbonation.



Overall: 5 - waited years to finally try this one. Will be sure to hunt it down again next time I'm in that part of the country.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.512 oz bottle into a Firestone Walker snifter. 13% ABV. Looks like it was bottled in June 2022, but that’s a guess through a clump of yellow numbers on the bottle neck.

Zero head, get straight to the point I guess.,

Smell is milk chocolate, plum, vanilla.

Tastes great. The chocolate and vanilla play nice and Satan sends a small heat spear on the tongue and back of the throat at the finish. Balanced rolling flavor profile.

Feel is not-quite motor oil thick, a little oily, very low carbonation, but enough to add a little fizzle to the sizzle.

Overall, a real treat. Big Stout!Sep 05, 2022"

Moderate level of head, which is medium brown. It recedes into a beige ring at the edge of the glass. Nearly black and opaque, which pours somewhat thickly. Sweet tinged, heavily toasted grain/wood and chili pepper on the nose. Not very sweet, smooth caramel and toasted wood flavors, with the added chili, cocoa, coffee and vanilla bean, blending into a subtle and singular note, which is really well done and probably not very easy to balance together and not become the main flavor component of a beer. At the very tail end of the finish, there is a bit of coffee, on the palate.Feb 22, 2022"

O: A very worthwhile imperial stout, not horrendously expensive. Prairie Artisan knows what they are doing. I'd buy it again.Dec 18, 2021"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Wow, what do I say about ""Bomb!""? I'm somewhat of an amateur, all I could focus on for this one was the overwhelming spiciness. Beyond that, I definitely taste the coffee and chocolate as the primary flavors. This flavor was very complex, which is why I gave it a 5. I strongly enjoy beers that are ""different,"" and this is nothing like I have ever tasted. Extremely interesting beer, this is about my 6th of the night, and at 13% ABV for this one, I'm pretty gone by now. If you enjoy ""different"" or ""unique"" beers this is for you.Nov 21, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Really good stout!!!! I bought a 12 oz. bottle at Half Time Distributors in Poughkeepsie NY, mainly because I am collecting bottle caps from all 50 states and Oklahoma was a real ""find"". I had no idea how really good this beer would be. Pours a totally dense black color with no light coming through. Surprising medium size dark tan/brown head with, what I would consider, a very long lasting head for a 13% abv beer. Aroma and taste have it all for a stout. Rich malty presence, strong coffee and chocolate presence, a little vanilla (good for me since I don't like prominent vanilla in my stouts and porters). I may have picked up some mild chili peppers in the first taste, but not after that. Mouthfeel is rich and fairly smooth, but with a little alcohol ""bite"" as befits the high octane. An excellent stout, I would gladly drink this one again as long as I was not expected to function 100% afterwards!!Oct 20, 2021"

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5Blend No. 2 (2018 release); consumed on 1/14/21



Pours a deep, jet-purple body with an airy half-finger of extra-pale mauve head, retreating quickly to a few paper-thin, spotty islands of cap, a sizeable, bubbly collar, and virtually no lacing beyond an occasional splotching isolated at various points around the glass.



Aroma shows fresh blackberry pits engaging with an increasingly rounded lactic funk, sharpwning over time while simultaneously embracing jammy blackberry and a deepening sweetness as the beer warms; old leather and wet stone peak over the middle into fresher oak and some grape-like tannins to close.



Taste ooens with suggestions of blackberry quijcly overtaken by lactic funk and a splintery oak profile; hints of dried peppercorn pair with a sturdy tannic structure into a mid-palate of barnyard funk and lemon zest, while tones of blackberry pits, lactic funk, and a brief burst of red berries mark the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fine, moderate-mild carbonation; a huge acidity is sharp and biting over the mid-palate, acetic and puckering though crisp into back end; a brief juiciness dries steadily with slight tannic textures on the finish.



Increasingly palatable as it warms, an overwhelming acidity remains dominant, relegating the blackberry to an underdeveloped background while largely glossing over the nuance of the funk; this wild ale is clearly designed competently and shows sporadic sparks of genuine depth, but a relentless imbalance ultimately takes away from the overall product.Jan 15, 2021"

4.03/5  rDev -10.6%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Batch 2 - 375ml bottle - poured into a zin stem at 45°F.



Pours a deep blackberry purple - foggy anf crimson when held to the light, with a lasting sudsy pinkish collar. The occasional rising bubble can be seen. Not as saturated, but quite similar to a merlot in appearance. 



Nose: Really wonderful blackberry presence here. That classic, instantly recognisable Side Project grist and culture character forms a simple foundation, with some toasty grain, bright acidity, and white oak, with subtle threads of hay, wheat, dusty leather, stone, petrichor, wet leaves, and lemon. The fruit is fresh, vibrant, and seedy, with an underlying jammy element. Reserved, but elegant. 



Palate: Thicket greets the palate with a sharp zing of acidity, with a ton of lacto-driven lemon juice pucker, and a bit of acetic bite following. Like many fruited Side Project wilds, there's an underlying sweetness that seems like it's from both the malt as well as some fructose. The sweetness tuns parallel to, but beneath the sourness, taming it a bit. The blackberry character is unmistakable, buy leans towards the dry, seedy, unripe, tart end of the spectrum, rather than juicy or saturated. The acidity is aggressive, and thankfully, burns fast and bright, settling down quickly, and revealing some grains and a bit of oak. Some ripe berry pokes through, along with some wine-soaked oak, finishing quick, clean, and dry. 



Mouthfeel/Body: Thicket is medium-light in body, wispy, fluid, and crisp. Puckering acidity up front causes some mouthwatering. Effervescence is fine, lively, amd sparkly. The finish is dry, with some very subtle oak tannins. 



Overall: This is one of those wild ales that could have been stellar if it wasn't so acidic. The reviews are polarising - some saying it's jammy, others, that it's crazy sour. As it warms, some ripe berry sweetness does begin to emerge, which helps a lot, and it does become enjoyable, but the aggressive acidity holds it back and stifles the complexity. It's certainly fruit-forward, and very much Side Project, but it isn't the most balanced or complex offering. This one is good, but not amazing.Jan 15, 2021"

Taste is super juicy blackberry, to the point of gummies, while dark oak and tannins come in mid-palate, capping off with only the faintest hint of nutty funk in the exhale.



Thicket is really puckering and tingly, yet somehow not painfully acidic at all. A playful effervescence runs thru the medium body coming to a just semi-dry finish.

Overall: Nice little gem. Much better than what I originally thought with a creamy feel to the brew which is hard to keep the glass down. Salud!Jul 02, 2022"

4.38/5  rDev -2.7%
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Very modest head production; decent retention. Lemon yellow body, opaque and murky but not unattractive or pulpy.



Fresh and hoppy nose, but a bit of a melange of citrus, tropical, and herbal aromas, with little in the way of individual notes to pick out. Pineapple, mango, tangerine, cream; little else that triggers anything. Still, it's a very pleasant, if not particularly complex, aroma profile.



Very juicy on the palate, with tropical notes leading the way, carrying a more restrained citrus edge and some herbal bite. Mango, papaya, pineapple, basil, oregano, lemon zest, mandarin orange. Orange creamsicle finish.



Smooth and creamy bite; top notch in the style.Jan 11, 2022"

Pours a black motor oil ,one finger brown foam cap recedes to a ring

Oh Holy Father the aroma as i cracked this open!

Natural maple syrup, pancakes, honey and sweet coffee.

Wow.

And it aint a bad looker either. Black body and beautiful inch thick creamy tan head.

Taste not as sweet as one ( me) would expect but it has all the taste profile of a down home old style diner pancake feed.

Mouth feel is thick and silky. Not one to have multiples off.

Brew #8 from the Hop Culture Juicy Brews box, a 16oz can poured into a glass coffee mug.



A: Moderately thick black pour; certainly dense and opaque but not the thickest stout ever. Capped by a creamy mocha head.



S: Delicious, decadent, rich coffee and maple syrup character. Chocolatey notes as well. The coffee isn't acrid or bitter, just smooth and rich and plays well with the maple syrup sweetness.



T: Yeah, so easy to drink - this is literally my wheelhouse. Just enough sugary maple syrup to be rich and decadent without being cloying; roasted malt profile bolsters up that sweetness, and the fresh coffee shines through with a breakfast-y feel to it.



MF: Again, not the biggest stout I've seen or tried but big enough, and the body stands up to the adjuncts.



O: Just delicious and darn near perfect for a maple syrup coffee stout.Feb 22, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer poured a brown-ish black color with an off-white head crowning the pour. 



Smell - Maple syrup stood out in the nose but there was some bitterness to lend a sense of balance.



Taste - The maple was huge, complemented by a dry bready backbone. A bit of charred dark coffee lent a sense of balance. The sweetness fades in the finish leaving a light coffee bitterness.



Mouthfeel - The body seemed a bit thin for a sweet stout, but it had stickiness.



Overall - The nice thing about this mapled stout was that it was not too heavy.Feb 21, 2021"

Smell presents with barrel and maple first, while coffee, vanilla, and cocoa provide a subtle background. Same notes on the taste with an additional cinnamon bite, very well balanced. A slight oiliness and thickness, medium to big body, boozy. I’ve always wanted to try one of their barrel aged stouts. This did not disappoint.Jun 17, 2022"

4.08/5  rDev -9.7%
look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Appearance - From the bottle, the beer poured a deep black color with dark brown bottles clinging to the sides of the glass. 



Smell - In the nose, the cinnamon lead the way with modest sweetness. 



Taste - In the profile, coffee led the way. Cinnamon came in second place, and it was not overdone but gave a nice element of spice. I struggle to find a vanilla notes and the barrel profile was mild. The coffee and cinnamon carried to the finish. 



Mouthfeel - The beer had some viscosity, allowing the main profile to linger. 



Overall - This one was a bit of a letdown for me.May 23, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5750ml bottle, caged and corked. Label has bottling date as '21 SEP 18', and a best before date of '26 OCT 38'.

Clear, medium gold colored body. One finger of white head sticks around as rising bubbles replenish. Slight strings of lacing.

Aroma is a complexity of funk, fruit and oak. The funk is musty and hay-like, the fruit is remindful of green apples, and the oak adds to both the slight sweetness and the tannins.

Taste is also complex, and sour in tone. The mustiness comes through in the funk notes, and the fruit has green apples that add to the sour tone. Big oak underlay. Rather quick to disperse and dry. The fruit funk lingers.

Mouth feel is light and substantial at the same time. Bubbly, and high in carbonation.

Excellent balance in its blending, and a pleasure to sip.Apr 15, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Frustrated. Lost my review three damn times due to page crashing. Now this will be a short review for a phenomenal tasting, which is annoying. 



Pours a honeyed golden orange. No real head to speak of, but a nice white ring surrounds the glass.



Complex nose that you need to smell yourself to truly experience it. Fruit notes of green apples, pears. Funky notes of general barnyard stuff, hay, some musty notes in there as well. Somewhat of a vinous smell, generic dark wine grapes here. Some wooden and oaky aromas. The smell is not an unrestrained Brett/super barnyard funk that smells like a horses barn that hasn’t been cleaned and smells like crap, and it’s not sour vinegar-y either. It’s even mildly sweet. 



Taste of apricots on the sip that morph into a green apple flavour. Some dried lemon and tangerine peel notes here, I think it’s the drying effect on your palate that give me that impression. Ever spritz a citrus peel and lick the peel itself? That kind of oily flavour is here, but it’s miles more gentle. A little bit of wheaty notes here as well, like some damp, whole wheat bread made with sprouted grains or something. Vinous character at times, like generic white wine grapes. It sort of dances between a lot of different flavours, and yet all of them meld together on each sip. It’s more like, on a particular sip a certain dancer does their solo before blending back in. It’s pretty remarkable all things considered. Some gentle leather like flavours that are sometimes accompanied by… a mild smoke flavour? I might just be shooting blanks here, but it feels like it. There is not, well… I don’t think it’s a savoury character to this. But there is this kind of umami flavour to it. Sort of like the character of blue cheese or yogurt, that sort of body. It’s not oily, particularly, because the sourness makes it more tart than anything. It’s really hard to nail down this character, especially as it warms and it comes out even more. Thankfully… I have another in the cellar!



Definitely sour, but not a puckering sour. There is even a mild sweetness. It finishes pretty dry, and surprisingly, finishes quite clean as well. No lingering sourness on the palate. Maybe some very mild fruits and the slightest hint of sweetness, which is really unique from a lot of sour beers I’ve tried. Good carbonation that creates a smooth sip, the carbonation is not particularly biting. Medium bodied.



This is my first real Geuze. I’ve had plenty of sours, but not a Geuze as of yet. And I’ve had plenty of terrible farmyard funky sour vinegar bombs that taste like they added 10 gallons of brettanomyces. This is not that. This is balanced, restrained and yet complex. For what the style is, it feels like an absolute benchmark. I am by no means an expert in this arena, but this is quite an experience for any beer drinker. My bottle was bottled early 2018. Which made this about 4 years old when I drank it. I have a second one I plan to age for another 4 years or so! Can’t wait to revisit it! To tide me over until then, I have many other 3 Fonteinen beers to try… the framboise may be next!Mar 14, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Pours a foggy, hazy burnt orange with a half finger of white fizzy foam. Head bubbles away quickly. Aroma is peach and apricot for fleshy fruits, but not overly juicy. It adds just a touch of initial sweetness. Stone, grass, and oak round it out. It has a slight tart funk to it, but is not 'sour'. Acidity remains balanced, and low. Flavor profile is stone, oak, grass, herbal, peach and faint apricot. It leads with that heavy stone, grassy, yeasty character, with a little build up of fruits at the finish. Tartness remains light or faint, offering just a touch of dynamic at the end. Acidity is low. Mouth feel is still in effervescence with just a little sparse pulp for any additional texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a sublime lambic that packs elegance into every sip. It's not big, bold, or brash, instead developing an endearing personality.

A: pours a deep burnt orange with a couple fingers of frothy tan head that faded away into a thin bubbly collar with soapy lace. 

S: musty earth/wood, bright acidity, mild citrus, wood, grain, and apple notes. 

T: follows the nose with musty/damp flavors and soft citrus, with the addition of darker grain/dark bread flavors. I get a touch of dark fruit followed by a cider-like note in the finish and apple skins in the aftertaste. There’s a earthy spice throughout along with a lingering funk to the aftertaste. 

M: frothy, creamy carbonation complimented by acidity that is sharp but quick. Medium body with a little chew to it. Not bone dry or thin. Acidity lingers but this drinks well. But if you want a few of the last sharp corners rounded off, give this a few more years of age. This is still pretty bright for 5 years. 

O: I had to pop a bottle on the day of Armand’s passing and felt this was a good fit. A lovely beer, just like the lovely man I hear Armand was. Fuck cancer; rest in piece.Mar 08, 2022"

4.57/5  rDev +1.6%
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Pours a cloudy opaque brownish tinged orange color. Very thin, fleeting off-white head appears as the beer is poured, but dissipates almost instantly. The aroma on this is very complex - there is a moderate funkiness on the nose that is immediately noticeable. Notes of tart green apple, white grapes, oak, dirty laundry, and a zippy lemon character.



The taste leans into the funk without as much of the tartness. There are notes of green apples, apple, lemon, some bleu cheese notes, strong oak with some mellow white grapes, wet blanket funkiness and some dry tannic notes. I feel like I get something else every time I take a drink of this beer. At times its funkier, and times it more fruity and tart, then it is drier and leans into that chardonnay like character. The complexity of this is amazingly balanced by a drinkability I have rarely found in these geuzes. I could actually envision drinking this all afternoon rather than just a single glass - although my heartburn would undoubtedly make me regret that. Still, this is a beautiful beer - complex, yet approachable.



The feel is medium bodied with bright, vibrant carbonation. The tartness in this dances up to the point of being puckering without ever actually reaching that point. It is definitely a drier beer especially on the back end into the finish.

A- pours a clear golden amber color with a one-finger foamy white head that has good retention

L: Pours a lovely clear burnished bronze-gold, and forms a thick, fluffy white head with great retention.



S: Funky, mildewy old dried hay, with sourdough biscuits being baked nearby, and some moldering orange peels.



T: Sharply tart underripe citrus opens, with a soft metallic tinge. That quickly segues into a swirl of sour white grapes, vinosity, green apple, and rancid honeydew melon, with a grass and mildew undertone. Old wood and pollen manifest by the finish, the aftertaste of which lingers as tart sour orange with mold and metal.



F: Verging between light and medium, with moderate carbonation.



O: This is a delight, as is the case with most 3F offerings.Dec 26, 2021"

Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Beautiful clear orangish yellow color with brief head and good lasting lacing. Wonderful smell and taste of tart apples and pears. Dry white wine.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5It just doesn't get any better than this. Deep-flavored lambic while also maintaining its delicate profile. Vintage was 2017-2018, consumed in late 2021. Clear gold color with a thin, yet long-lasting pure white head. Lacing doesn't quit. Very champagne-like in flavor--tastes range from white grapes to citrus to oak, with a bit of funk. Sweet up front, with a semi-dry finish. This is some special stuff, quite possibly the best geuze I've had. Save it for a special occasion, but make it an annual purchase because every year brings new qualities.Nov 19, 2021"

Aromas on this are defined by complex flowery and spicy vanilla, bakers chocolate and lighter molasses among a well accentuated, toasty, oaken barrel.



The beer’s mouthfeel is rich and decadent, smooth and heavy with a fitting lower carbonation, which manages to develop a late effervescence, leading to a pleasant refreshment.



Tastes of milk chocolate, spicy molasses and toffee, together with a warming, weatherbeaten, yet elegant, sweet and flowery appearing barrel. Got an earthy coffee bean dry- and roastiness going on, gently balanced by lots of soothing whipped cream and chocolate cake. Finishes with a warming, sweet spiciness, lingering, licorice accompanied vanilla bean and more chocolate among an evenly spicy, yet toasty maintaining barrel dryness.



This got an A+ balance to it with a truly fulfilling mouthfeel and a well working adjunct, establishing a nice interplay with the prominent barrel in this. Well done!Jan 23, 2022"

Price: $18.00 at the brewery



It pours a viscous black color in the glass with a mocha-colored head. When poured cold, the flavor profile leads with chocolate wafer cookies, bourbon-vanilla heat, and rich dark chocolate. As it warms, the true complexity emerges. We taste and smell bourbon chocolate chip cookie dough, bourbon vanilla ice cream, tootsie rolls, and smooth chocolate syrup.



The vanilla addition serves to soften the bourbon and chocolate character of the base beer making the whole presentation more confectionary and decadent like chocolate vanilla syrup.



Appearance: 4 - definitely black, but poured a bit thin. Not much head.



Nose: 5 - oh my. No explosion in the nose, just smells very well blended and not too sweet.



Taste: 5 - hmm, really interesting. Not too much vanilla. The barrel really hits on the back end.



Mouth: 5 - much thicker than expected. Supremely smooth. Incredibly well crafted.



Overall: 5 - okay, I wasn't blown away. Could have used more vanilla, but I'm nitpicking.

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75Drank from a 12 oz. white wax dipped bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA

Served in a Tree House teku



Viscous, complete pitch black appearance. The dense, oily looking body was capped by a small film of coffee colored bubbles that quickly dissolved. A thin, lasting ringlet encircled the liquid.



The aroma was a bit underwhelming initially but improved dramatically after a few minutes. Fresh vanilla bean came through strong. Good amount of sweet, sticky caramel and toffee pudding notes too. Moderate bourbon presence. As the beer warmed, both the bourbon and the vanilla really intensified. Dark fruits were also apparent.



The flavor profile was just as impressive as the aroma. Super rich, malty and robust. Nice roasted and caramel malt presence on the front end. Loads of fresh vanilla bean too. Moderately sweet. Dark fruits were detectable in the center. Bit of chocolate fudge as well. Bourbon barrel notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate and intensified on the finish. More lingering boozy bourbon, vanilla and sweetness after the swallow.



Outstanding mouthfeel. Rich, creamy and full bodied for the style. Super oily and dense on the palate. The liquid contained a finely bubbled, moderate effervescence that turned super frothy and smooth. After a few sips, the beer deposited a sticky film on my lips.



Tree House’s Blend Two was a big disappointment, but Vanilla Bean Truth definitely lived up to the hype. The fresh vanilla bean notes were intense but not overwhelming, and the bourbon presence was punchy though not overly hot or boozy. I hope these guys continue to releases more barrel-aged bangers like this.Oct 09, 2020"

Despite all that, I can settle myself and dig in. As I do, here in this 8 ball black, short mocha headed ale, I get chocolate raspberry sticks and not a ton of barrel. There's just a little bite of slightly herbal wood, which I think more than anything helps to bring us to a powder dry finish.



I can see how this would have made the news in its heyday (see what I did there?), but in today's world of absolute confections and bombastic feats of oak, it's quite underwhelming.Nov 23, 2021"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by @FBarber during NBS BIF #13.



Gorgeous pour. Body traps light. Completely dark. Lovely finger of soft dark brown foam. Quite the beaut.



Nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough there's a hint of raspberries layered in there as well. Inviting.



The berries are much more prevalent here, beginning at the first sip. It starts off as just kind of a general berry/fruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components I will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note. We'll come back to this later. The build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel. This brings us back to the raspberry. You know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness? It's one of the great things about them, is they offer a balance and a range of experience, and that presents here. The finish has some bitter from the coffee, and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency (that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there) to give it a little 'ooh!' to the finish. Really enjoyable.



Body is velvety smoothe, and that tart finish I descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein. Would not descibe it as hot, but it isn't shy about it's double digit ABV.



I'm really enjoying this. Raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing, but I feel like I still don't see it quite as often as I'd expect, in beer. I think it really really works well here, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Frank!May 10, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Appearance - Poured into a sampler, the beer was a murky deep black color with a dark tan head. 



Smell - Raspberries were strong in the nose, paired with a definite bourbon presence. 



Taste - Raspberry is tough to capture in a beer. The raspberry seemed fresh, without overdoing it or making it seem artificial. The sweetness is balanced by roasted malts and a little bourbon sting. The finish was slightly warming, though never overly sweet. 



Mouthfeel - Before there were slushies with gobs of fruit puree, Haymarket made a nice thick stout with fruit. 



Overall - I enjoyed this beer as the raspberries were well presented and not artificial tasting.Mar 14, 2020"

About as pretty a beer as I’ve ever seen. Pitch black with a 1-finger khaki head leaving lovely lacing.

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Appearance: Black, ok head.



Smell: Very rich, big chocolate, coffee, wood, vanilla.



Taste: Thick and coating, big chocolate flavor, bit of maple in the background. Chocolate and mild wood on the finish. Barrel is very well incorporated.



Overall: Finally saw this one on shelves again so picked up a four pack. Wow, extremely impressed! This beer lives up to the hype for me, big chocolate but perfectly balanced—not too sweet, not too bitter. Barrel is well integrated, not boozy despite being 11%. Really great stuff!Oct 15, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75I warmed to this beer slowly, but it's now easily my favorite KBS variant, as well as my favorite stout from Founders overall. Title implies the stout may be sickeningly sweet, but there is nothing excessive here. It still tastes like beer, not a dessert, and it makes for a great sipper. And contrary to some comments made by others, I found the stout thick, like a few stouts that have been condensed. As for price, I've become more accepting. I would not be willing to pay $8 for a 6 oz pour at a bar (unless I was already drunk), but paying $5 or $6 per 12 oz bottle seems an acceptable transaction. (As for the ""hazelnut"" variant, I'd rather a few Guinness.)Sep 22, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.25Pours a thick dark brown with a tight, small cappuccino head. 



Big aroma on this beer. Sweetened coffee, chocolate. Some maple as it warmed. A little indistinct booze. 



The taste follows, but fuller. Creamy sweet coffee. Milk chocolate. A hint of maple. Alcohol. 



Body is on the thinner side despite the rather thick looking pour. 



This is a great variant of the original, a beer I like quite a bit. Given the choice between a KBS and this, I might choose this one.Jun 06, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter



A: Pours nearly black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves some very nice lacing. 



S: Decadent chocolate fudge, some coffee, roasty earthy notes, smooth bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, maple, and faint oak, and hints of toasted coconut. 



T: Big chocolate fudge runs the show up front, followed by coffee, vanilla, smooth bourbon, brown sugar, a touch of maple, roasty earthy notes, and faint hints of toasted coconut and oak. 



M: Medium to full body, mild carbonation, creamy smooth, alcohol is nearly completely hidden, crazy drinkable for a sweet 11%. 



O: The second I heard about this beer it topped my wants list, so it's nice to finally dive into a bottle. 

I really grew to appreciate this one the more it warmed and opened up. It's a big sweet dessert stout, the first few sips make that very clear, and they absolutely nailed the fudge factor. It's also surprisingly easy to drink for something so big and sweet, which I came to realize is due to the solid foundation of coffee that kept peeking out more and more as my glass emptied. Is it my favorite form of KBS, probably not. But it makes a fantastic desert beer.Mar 25, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high dense dark tan head that left a wide collar around the edge of the glass.

S: Moderate aromas of chocolate and vanilla-like oak are present in the nose along with notes of toasted coconut.

T: The taste has lots of flavors of bourbon and associated vanilla along with notes of chocolate and toasted coconut. The alcohol is very well hidden from the taste.

M: It feels full-bodied and very smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. The alcohol lends some warming to the finish.

O: This beer does a very good job at blending the flavors together as no one flavor overpowers the others. It is also rather drinkable considering its strength.

Amazing stuff.

Very dark brown with a one finger beige head quickly fading away.

Coconut is very nicely present alongside the barrel notes of vanilla and reinforcing the notes of coconuts. 

It's about toffee and cocoa. 

Overall it's very balanced. 

The mouthfeel is not thin but not too thick either, preventing this to be a cloying beverage. 

A wonderful brewJan 05, 2021"

750 ml bottle, batch 24 5/20, poured into an Ourison glass



A- A hazy copper with a three finger white head.



S- Sour, pears, lemons, wheat, floral, wheat, mild funk, a slightly sweet sap like earthiness.



T- Sour, lemons, pears, wheat, mild funk, floral, nice earthiness.



M- Smooth, soft, fluffy, light body.



O- A wonderful saison and very easy to drink. I would have liked maybe a little more funk and a little less sour. Definitely leaning hard into how some American breweries have made saisons more sour than funky, but that doesn’t take away from how good this is.Oct 11, 2020"

Attractive hazy yellow color with a medium amount of fluffy white head, a thin layer of which lingers for some time. Tons of lacing, which is unusual, at least for the saisons / farmhouse ales I typically drink. Definitely picking up the sour on the nose, although it's not overwhelming. Taste is pleasantly tart and just the tiniest bit of funk in the aftertaste. Feel is pillowy soft and smooth. Less carbonation than I expected based on the effervescence that was present upon opening the bottle. This is a very well done saison.Aug 02, 2020"

Aroma is quite fantastic, a combination of raspberry jam with the slight mustiness of a kriek. It's got jammy raspberry with some overt tartness. There's also an underpinning of chamomile. They say don't meet your heroes and often times with beer, it feels like you are set up for disappointment when you have a highly sought after and/or highly regarded beer. This is a true icon of the lambic game and rightfully so.Jul 30, 2022"

Ruby red in the glass with a small fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are balanced between raspberry and cherry pie filling, with a nice lemony acidity from the base lambic. Flavors are tart, a bit less fruity than expected, with more of a raspberry character. Overall I like it, although not quite as much as Framboos

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Two year old bottle.



Beautiful strawberry color in the glass, completely transparent if decanted - darker and murkier with the yeast, however, nearly completely opaque. I prefer my yeast be included in my Belgians (for health, of course), but I'm not holding that against the appearance score. Pale pink fizzy head, brief lived, leaving the body completely still.



Extraordinary nose: tart and fruity, but equally funky, earthy, and sharp. Earthy, dirty, mushroom-like funk; raspberry and cherry; oak and must; a great example of the oft-mocked ""horse blanket.""



The palate has less earthy funk, but it's still there, especially on the back half. Up front, it's a blend of the sharp tartness of the berries and a light white wine vinegar-like sourness. Cherry skins and raspberry on the back third and finish.



Strongly sour, more in line with many American takes on sours and wild ales than most Belgian Lambics, owing at least in part to the sharpness of the berries. Mouth puckering; lingering sourness about the gums. Swishing, swirling, and chewing is almost dangerous. There's no vinegar burn, however.



This is world class, but if more of the funkiness translated to the palate and cut through the sourness, it would be among the best beers I've ever had. As it is, it's easily one of the best fruited Lambics in the world, different in character from Cantillon, but just as good. Perhaps the funk becomes more pronounced with age.Jan 17, 2022"

Moderate to vigorous pour yields a 1/2 inch light pink head over a hazy cherry red body with no lacing as the head disappears in seconds.



Wonderful nose of cherry and raspberry with slight funk.



Taste mirrors nose with the funk a bit more prevalent. 

Very tart in the best way at the finish.

Wow!



Good feel after the initial appearance.



Overall, a delicious lambic!

Seek this one out!!

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Bottled 3 years ago (2018).



Pours deep, medium-hazy red with a finger of off-white head.



The nose is raspberry, cherry, lemon, and vinegar.



The taste opens with medium-sour lemon, vinegar, and green olive and finishes with raspberry and cherry. Very low sweetness and medium tartness. The initial pop of vinegar and green olive is somewhat off-putting, but the beer becomes more balanced and fruity as it warms and my palate adjusts.



The mouthfeel is medium for the style. Puckering tartness with a clean finish.



Overall, a very well-made lambic, maybe not my favorite flavor profile at the end of the day but it definitely grew on me. It could use a touch more jammy sweetness to offset the vinegar.Sep 05, 2021"

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4.5Bottled on 9/18/2013 - consumed on 7/18/2021. Poured from a caged-and-corked 375mL bottle into my Drie de Fonteinen tumbler. 



Cloudy cinnabar body supports a thin layer of very pale pink foam which dissipates to a vague collar pretty rapidly; poor retention, no legs. 



Intensely, flamboyantly aromatic - suffused with bright berry, cherry, and fine aged red wine vinegar notes. Wild and complex.



Bracing acidity, with pepper and mild cheese notes quickly overwhelmed by tart fruit. Perfectly blended lambic with nuts, peppercorn, wildflower, honey, and foraged greens emerging occasionally beneath the raspberry and barnyard notes. Some minerality but not too many tannins in the finish, which while dry, isn't puckering. 



Milky, smooth mouth-feel - could do with a tiny bit more carbonation perhaps, but it isn't bad for the style. 



A fitting tribute - one of the best examples of the style I've had in quite some time.Jul 18, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5First beer of 2022! Poured from a bottle (11Feb2020 - no 37 - 19|20) into a geuze glass



L: pours a turbid, darker orange yellow with a moderate, crackling white head. Moderate visible carbonation feeding the minimal head. Think I stirred the lees moving the bottle from the fridge, my bad. Second glass, while still turbid, is notably less so - more of a brighter, golden yellow. Some chunky lacing left with each sip



S: that classic, seductive 3F geuze nose. Pleasant bit of barnyard funk to open, with some bright fruit notes quickly behind. Slight cheese, assertively but appropriately acidic - on the fruit front, granny smith apple, bit of lemon flesh, some white peach. Some chardonnay grape as well. Great mix of bright fruit and complex, earthy funk



T: great swallow, delivers a nice mix of fruit and sour with bright acidity. Slight pucker at first with notes of green apple, bright and pronounced citrus. That lemon flesh character from the nose comes through well here, pleasantly sharp and leads into the medium-long finish. That more cheesy barnyard funk is more toward the finish, leaves this great lingering note with a rustic baked bread flavor as well. Flavor dances nicely in that unique way, really nice



F: medium- body, medium+ carbonation. Nicely drying, that bit of tart that suggests a nice sip



O: wonderful and tasty geuze. Bright acidity and pleasant, complex funk; solid fruit character, big fanJan 02, 2022"

So excited to finally try this bottle that I got in a trade from Belgium. We're finally seeing a bit more 3 Fonteinen in Chicago with them dropping Intense Red and Homage in mass recently. It's a very pretty lambic. A medium hued peach in color with nice carbonation and lacing that stays around. I don't get as much off the nose as I would like while it's cold but the flavors jump out more on the tongue thankfully. As it warmed the lambic funk started to come through. There's so much happening flavor wise here. Tartness is medium to medium high. I wish there were a bit more funk but it's present. It recognizable as a 3 Fonteinen beer immediately to me. The feel is superb with the carbonation and dry finish. Overall I don't know if it's my favorite 3F, but it's up there. Worth picking up a 2nd one if you can get 2.Dec 31, 2021"

Pours a golden-copper with notable floaties and particles suspended in the beer. Head is a finger of white foam. Aroma is lemongrass, herbal, stone, and apricot. Apricot isn't forward, molding into the surroundings for a subtle twist of sweetness. Nose has a light tanginess to it, but it's faint. Flavor profile is apricot forward, which lays on top of herbal, lemongrass, and stone. Finish is notably tangy and funky, much more so than the nose. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a near still effervescence. Overall, soft and plump, just like a ripe apricot.

Can, thanks to DC, to tulip glass. 





LOOK: murky hazy yellow, beautiful cream colored head with excellent retention. Beautiful.

AROMA: grapefruit, vegetable, cantaloupe, pineapple. A little light. 

TASTE: pine resin, general citrus tries to fend of the pine but can't quite do it. Some light touches of pepper, spice, melon. Pine dominates upfront and in the finish with a temporary splish of citrus in the middle.



FEEL: medium body, good carbonation, touch of astringency. 





Well crafted, just too bitter for my tastes.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours a bright and hazy yellow. A finger of soapy white head. Solid retention, some lacing. A dense haze leading to minimal light penetration. 



Nose is sweet peach, citrus, grass, melon and grapefruit. Melons along the lines of honeydew and cantaloupe. Very nice cornucopia of fruits. Nice sweetness with a good balance of grassy hop presence. 



Taste is similar. Peach, citrus, and melon, and a relatively strong weed dankness that wasn't as present on the nose. Also it could just be a phantom effect but I get brief moments of raspberry. Medium bitterness, almost reaching something on the higher side of what you'd expect on a NEIPA. mild to medium hop burn as you drink, building on the back of the throat. Very mild cracker malt backbone. Barely shows up and is overwhelmed by the fruit, weed, and grass presence. 



Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied for a NEIPA. Mild carbonation. The hop bitterness and alcohol level, makes this brew feel a little more harsh and bubbly than it actually is.



Overall an enjoyable NEIPA. This one is a big boy. Juicy, sweet, and dank. I personally preferred Cutting Tiles, but there is still many Trillium IPAs to try and I look forward to future entries into this brewery.Sep 25, 2020"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Poured from a can dated 2 days ago (fresh!) into a tulip glass. Pours an opaque pale orange/yellow color (like white grapefruit juice) with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention. Scents of sweet tropical punch and candy. I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV. My first time trying heavy mettle (I’ve had one in the alloy series and death mettle) and I think this one is my fav of the bunch. May not be your bag if you don’t like the sweetness that this recipe invokes, but I’m definitely digging it.Aug 26, 2020"

4.14/5  rDev -8%
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Pours a slightly murky starburst dark orange with a finger and a half of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is earthy, citrusy, tropical fruity hops with a sprig of bready and earthy malts. Together it nets out a modestly sweet aroma. Flavor profile is tropical fruits and citrus packed in front of a lightly rindy, earthy, herbal hop blend. Hops are stacked on top of bready and earthy malts. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a very soft carbonated texture. Overall, fun and playful with slightly rindy earthy, citrusy hops that keep it drinking smooth and balanced. Not a typical juice bomb.

Strong weedy, grassy aroma. Some pineapple and grapefruit as well.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Poured at fridge temp. Pours black as night. A minuscule layer of brown head appears and then flees. Tiny bubbles throughout. 



The nose is insane. Big toffee and dark fruit. Raspberries come to mind right away, but after a few minutes that fades a bit. In comes cocoa nibs, cinnamon, coconut, vanilla, and coffee. 



The taste is amazing. Coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon are apparent. Maple syrup seems a lot stronger now. However, the cinnamon and coffee are strong. Flavors are intense. 



Mouthfeel is pretty thick and the beer is clearly low in carbonation. Overall, a wonderful and intense beer!Jan 01, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Good head production and decent retention. The body is wonderfully dark, as is the dark brown head, while it lasts.



The aroma on this is powerful and decadent. From the moment of the pour, to sitting in the glass feet away, I'm getting strong notes of chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Up close, it's even sweeter, with vanilla, syrup, honey, and brown sugar joining the mix, along with cinnamon and chilies. The nose is, quite simply, wonderful.



Despite the sweetness of the nose, the brew is quite roasty and bitter up front. Light but noticeable pepper heat. Tons of dark fruit flavor, blackstrap molasses, oak, and bitter chocolate; slightly vegetal. Lasting prune and raisin, along with bourbon, on back third, leading to chocolate and cinnamon on the finish.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5500mL bottle into a snifter

Vintage 2021



A: Pours midnight black and somewhat viscous in appearance. Immensely dark head of 1plus fingers width dissipates at a moderate rate. Leaves only a few patches of lacing. 4.75



S: Aroma is, my god. Massive cinnamon, big chocolate, vinous dark fruits, luscious bourbon, capsaicin peppery heat, red wine. Barrel notes are moderate in strength and compliment the beer wonderfully. Some base beer notes primarily roasted malt. Fire roasted marshmallows rounds it out. Goodness gracious. 4.75



T: Taste is also excellent, albeit perhaps a bit less voluptuous. I again get huge vinous and red wine notes up front, hell is actually tastes like it’s red wine barrel

aged. Next comes the cinnamon and rich, fine high cocoa content dark chocolate. On the finish there is roasted malt, charred oaky bourbon notes, some balancing bitterness. This is just wave after wave of flavors and it’s quite frankly just impressive. 4.75



M/D: Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. ABV is not noticeable which is impressive. Drinkability, however, is quite limited. The combination of the heavy/thick feel and adjunct laden flavor profile make 500mL of this feel like 3 gallons (and this is coming from someone who drinks Bourbon County all the time and even old school 750mL Black Tuesdays without any trouble). 4



O: Overall, this is quite the beer. Normally beers this adjunct heavy can be not really my thing, but this one just pulls it off wonderfully. Probably more appropriate as an 8oz pour as opposed to a 500mL solo bottle, but still, well done Cigar City, well done. 4.5Mar 19, 2021"

If this is what 6 weeks out tastes like, what must it be fresh? Superb construction: gentle but full layers of tangerine, passion fruit, with an incredibly soft mouthful…next to no bitterness, but there is a kind of malty thickness that adds to and also restrains the fruity juiciness.

Loved this beer originally two weeks ago, but these had on the best by date aren't jumping out at me quite as much. I actually do not think it's because of age, just my palate being a little different when I did this review.



That aside, this is still a very good IPA, especially if I am patient enough to let it warm to the proper temperature from my cold fridge. The look is a quite highly hazed, near but not 100% opaque. As with many HF beers, the head and lacing are pretty strong.



Nose is a mix of tangerine, grapefruit, and some form of sweet fruit - I want to say a little pineapple. There's a light herbal note that comes somewhat as a muted mint to me, but is definitively a foreshadowing of some form of bitterness in the taste.



Medium heft, maybe a little less, with a prickly carbonation biting through the softer edges. More citrus rind and fruit - tangerine, orange, and some sweet ruby grapefruit, with a little huskiness from the barley and/or other grains. Not really any of the tropical fruit accent from the nose. The back end is bitter, but it has an interesting sheen of maltiness to it. Bittersweet leaning heavily on the first part, the latter keeps things from getting out of hand. As expected, a well constructed brew that brings both malt and hop to the experience.Sep 28, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours a bright, completely opaque, orange color. Thick, sudsy off white head forms, then dissipates leaving a quarter inch of foam in the glass along with plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma has notes of tangerine, orange marmalade, grass, dried vegetation and a slight woody character to it.



Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange, orange marmalade, and peach giving way to a grassy, vegetal, woody hop character on the back end. Clearly the Riwaka are coming through on the back end. Moderately bitter, mildly sweet, completely delicious. Feel is moderately bodied, smooth, and pretty easy drinking. Moderate carbonation.



This is a really nice IPA from Hill Farmstead - they get so much out of the hops both in the aroma and taste, its impressive.Aug 30, 2021"

4.49/5  rDev -0.2%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours a rather cloudy orangeade color with a two finger head; solid persistence and streaks of lace



Smell: There are both grassy and floral tones here, with stone fruit and lemon in the mix



Taste: The flavors here are subtle but bring an interesting spectrum; stone fruit and passion fruit are featured, with a lemon aspect; the bitterness builds nicely but is held in check so that it doesn't overwhelm



Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation



Overall: A very nice IPA but the progeny has boosted this to the top of the IPA charts; not saying it doesn't belong there but I wonder whether the subtlety would shine as much in a blind tastingJul 31, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Received from a friend in exchange for a collection of Equilibrium DIPAs/TIPAs...



L: beautiful, rich golden maize color with a 3/4"" of thick head that dissipated after a few minutes. Somewhat opaque, owing to the unfiltered packaging.

S: some clean, piney wafts along with a noseful of citrus and sugary-sweet hops (maybe the Riwaka?). Very appealing.

T: bright citrus scent on the nose makes its way down but is quickly subdued by dank and slightly bitter (WA state?) hops that make for a really interesting APA. 

F: mild carbonation, very quaffable. Hop bitterness lingers nicely. 

O: a near-perfect rating for good reason; this is a great take on a classic variety that has been overshadowed by the new shiny toy (NE/hazy IPAs). Fantastic beer.Jul 05, 2021"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Pours jet black, with a delayed yet aggressive dark tan head. Shockingly dense and abiding for having so much coconut.



Aroma is pure sweetened coconut.. and honestly, I am struggling to find anything else. It’s quite overpowering, and while the aroma is very nice, I’m missing the barrel and the coffee to balance it all out.



Oh my god, so much coconut. Sticky, milk chocolate covered coconut candy, coagulated coconut oil, oaky bourbon, espresso brownie batter. It’s a good thing it’s a 12 oz can. Any more and it would be tough to finish. As it warms, it becomes very sweet, and syrupy. Begging for more barrel, but it just barely squeaks through.



Don’t get me wrong, it’s very good, but it’s the definition of “pastry stout.” Pushing the limits of sweet ingredients that you can hardly recognize that it’s beer anymore. A touch of restraint or a tweak in ratios would have done wonders for the beer.Mar 19, 2022"

Pours near black and opaque, thick looking, with a half inch foamy head and light, foamy cling. Aromas of coconut, coffee, bourbon, malt, chocolate. All distinct and vibrant. The flavors are also distinct and intense- coconut, coffee, bourbon, chocolate, malt, some vanilla as it warms. Smooth, an excellent full body, appropriately carbonated. 



This is one fine beer. Strong and flavorful coconut, with the barrels and coffee right behind in flavor and impact. Just delicious. Extremely enjoyable.Jun 11, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 416oz can, dated 10.13.2020, poured into a Half Acre ""occult"" snifter glass.



The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and opaque with a thin khaki head, loose bubbles and no retention nor lacing. The aroma is pleasant, lots of rich chocolate, charred oak, bourbon spirit, hot and a little bit of fusel alcohol comes through, vanilla, coconut, rich coffee and stone fruits. The flavors are nice, lots of rich chocolate, nice coffee that offers a bit of acidity and fruitiness that draws out some more darker stone fruits. The barrel has a lot of heat, lots of char but offers some toasted coconut, toffee and caramel forward bourbon while being dominated at the finish by alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick, heavy body with a warm and smooth finish.



Verdict: A nice Benthic variant, but definitely the booziest Benthic I've come across. The balance starts off well but suffers a bit from the heat of this beer and the coffee is the element that fails to come across the most.Mar 08, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.252020 vintage (released on 2/14/20, so presumably bottled within a few days of that date); consumed on 2/4/21



Pours a glossy, motor-oil black body topped with a barely-formed, mocha head, quickly fizzling to a spotty array of paper-thin islands of cap, expansive, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of short-lived, webby lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.



Aroma expresses dulled notes of brownie batter cut with boggy ethanol as a slight black raspberry accents upfront; dark chocolate, caramel, and touches of pipe tobacco develop sparingly against a core focused intently on rawer bourbon tones and distinctly wet oak barrel; some molasses and burnt brown sugar factor in toward the back end.



Taste bursts intently with waves of silky drinking chocolate, refined and creamy while leveled with a slight nuttiness; molasses progresses as the bourbon character deepens, forming notes of caramel brittle, burnt marshmallow, and brown sugar over the mid-palate as coffee bean meets bittersweet, malty char on the back end; a slightly smoky, ashy char finishes.



Mouthfeel brings put a fluid medium body elevated with a timely, fluffy burst of carbonation rounding into a silky grit over the mid-palate; heavy roast expands on the back end to counterbalance a growing bitterness with ample char, while a slightly sticky character gently coats the palate into an otherwise moderately dry finish.



From initial impressions of muddled heat and subdued malts, a level of forward, confident brilliance is expressed in equal parts sweetness and roast; the final product is an amazing flow of enveloping character, seemingly unending in its influx of intrigue and detail despite any apparent shortcomings.Feb 05, 2021"

Pours a seemingly fluid deep midnight black. A very minimal dark mocha head recedes fast leaving a persistent bubbly collar. The beer clings to glass, draping down and staining it brown. Oil spill. 



Nose: Aroma opens very strong and saturated. Notes of bourbon-soaked brown sugar, drippy molasses, burned soft caramel, English toffee, demerera sugar, encapsulated by very heavily charred oak. The roast lends some milk chocolate, cacao nib, and a deep burnish character. Some bramble dark fruit and current highlight brightness, with ethanol fumes are quite apparent, and paired with this densely musty, sopping oak character, detracts from the otherwise rich depth. 



Palate: Waves of rich, silken, malt-driven fudgy roast, caramel, toffee, cacao nib, burned brown sugar, and molasses lend an initial sweetness that is rich and decadent, before an almost unrealistic degree of flame-charred, bourbon-soaked oak barrel comes in and cuts it down quickly. Big burly bourbon notes, with toffee, coconut, pipe tobacco, vanilla caviar, and an almost bark-like tannin structure. The barrel and roast overtake the sweetness, and pair together for an exquisitely lengthy finish.



Mouthfeel/Body: Shying away from the thick, vicious, chewy theme, Midnight Still manages to deliver all the fudgy richness from the malt, with the sweetness fading by the finish, and replaced by dense, oily barrel. A nice fluidity allows it to remain drinkable, without ever approaching cloying, surrounded by a soft, fluffy carbonation. 



Overall: There's so much going on here that seems so unique to this beer. This is not a replica of another - it is not a waxed Bourbon County. This is a beautifully seamless execution of balance between malt complexity and full-on bourbon barrel assault, with the only real thing dragging it down is the ethanol and musty earthiness in the aroma. This is one for the books.Feb 05, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Had this Sep 3, 2016 as part of corpulent's birthday jam. Drank this at that golf course I can't remember the name of up at Lake Tahoe. 



Has the requisite 'used motor oil' kind of pour in viscosity and appearance. Aroma went hard on the bourbon and ashtray. Behind that you had some chocolate like fudge notes and an even smaller vanilla quotient. 



Once again, bourbon dominates the taste, but it manages to push one of the biggest bourbon portfolio's without being too boozy or by eliminating all other beer aspects. As if KBS was less coffee and chocolate but more bourbon. Drinks smooth while still being able to drop some smoke and ash notes the whole time. Hint of dark fruit creeps in as it warmed up on the back 9. 



I don't necessarily think this is better than the all time classics of barrel aging (KBS, Eclipse, BCS, CW), but it can definitely hang with them. Would be interesting to see what the score for this would be if it were a lot easier to acquire, I imagine a little bit less, but not significantly. It is top notch.Jun 19, 2020"

A- Oil black pour from the waxed bottle into a snifter. A small nutty brown foam layer appears on top of the beer with decent retention leaving spotty lace.



S- Bang on balance of roast bittersweet stout and decadent sticky, aged distillery basement and oak bourbon barrels. The Bourbon alone is unreal, peppery spicy sticky booze and fruit notes. Fudge and rich cocoa balanced perfectly by boozy whiskey. Roast barley. Hints of vanilla. Truly Bourbon mastery.



T- No arguing that the Bourbon is the star of the show but there is enough malt character to balance to near perfection. Bitter roast barley and fruity dark chocolate bars, french roast coffee beans, pepper, vanilla hints, brownies, boozy edge, caramel, oak wood degradation and nuttiness. Again it tastes like Buffalo Trace's sticky sweet bourbon barrel house. Strong oak bourbon malts but all pretty balanced, just HUGE.



MF- Thick and slick oily monster. The booze tames the hefty body quite a bit finding a nice middle ground. Slightly creamy and chewy. Ends warm.



The Bourbon barrel character in this beer is basically unmatched from what I have come across in the last ten years. A great surprise to be able to drink this brew in Maine and one of the best beers I have had in quite some time. Hopefully can visit this brewery again some day.Jan 22, 2020"

The taste exudes the balanced fruits, and the mouthfeel is thicker than the beer itself, but not too thick where it becomes overwhelming or chewy. It is still thin and refreshing. I have had this on draft, in bottles (19 and 20 releases) and have loved every sip of it. It is well-blended and balanced, and a refreshing and enjoyable combination of tartness and fruitiness.

A: Murky Arnold Palmer hue with 1-finger foamy white head with below average retention and spotty lacing.



S: Blasts of lemon, lime, guava, mango, peach, grapefruit, and orange with an herbal, honeysuckle note and a bit of malt sweetness. Esters are moderate and candy-fruity in nature.



T: Unapologetic flavor assault with lemon, lime, guava, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, and definite notes of honeysuckle and marijuana in the late palate and aftertaste. Esters are a little lower in intensity in the flavor but add the same candied fruit notes as the aroma. Bitterness is low-medium and alcohol is well-hidden. Delicious hazy IPA.



M: Medium-bodied with more dry finish than most NEIPAs.



O: A high-aroma, high-flavor NEIPA that is a superb example of the style and amazingly made it to my local store within a reasonable time! Thanks Wine Warehouse for spreading the delicious high-demand beer around.Aug 08, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Looks like watered down orange juice with opaque body and a medium collar of white bubbles. Nose is vaguely citrusy before a swirl. After, I get a punch of OJ when I first did this. Later attempts paired that scent with some floral tropical notes and an earthy bitterness.



First taste was earthy and very bitter, but that seemed an anomaly after a few more of them. It remained a bitter beer, but some balance returned. After some sips, the earthy to dirty nature wasn’t completely shook and firmed the base. Hints of grapefruit and orange rind act as lead-ins to pine in the form of both wood and dark green needles.

4.45/5  rDev -1.1%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer was hazy yellow in color with a fluffy white one inch head crowning the glass.



Smell - The nose was initially fruity, but the bitterness came forward later.



Taste - The taste was initially pretty mild with notes of papaya and mango. The profile shifted to bitter lemon rind and pine notes. A light bready backbone was present. In many ways, it was like drinking liquid lemon rind. The bitterness of the lemon lingered. This tasted like a take-no-prisoners west coast IPA.



Mouthfeel - The body was huge, cloudy like a NEIPA. Carbonation was somewhat smothered by the body.



Overall - I was a bit surprised by the bitterness, but I liked it.Jun 25, 2022"

4.11/5  rDev -8.9%
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.2512oz can, tulip, 2021 vintage. 



Oily, almost black, and nearly still. There is a thin head that’s quite dark brown. 



Hershey’s syrup, vanilla, rich bourbon, some soy sauce, and it’s vinous, with overripe red grape and fruit. The bourbon isn’t over the top, rather it’s woody, rich, and elegant. 



Ok, now that fat juicy grape bursts and mixes with melting chocolate bar, blackberry jam, walnut, and strong vanilla in the finish. The chocolate is a backdrop, weaving together Hershey’s syrup, dark chocolate Milky Way, and cocoa powder. The grape flavor is surprising in its strength. 



Very smooth, medium bodied, light and discrete carbonation. 



The flavors are intense and rich even though the body isn’t super rich. The bourbon is well done.Nov 07, 2021"

4.37/5  rDev -3.1%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with a dark tan head. Little carbonation was visible. 



Smell - The nose was just like chocolate marshmallows. It was big and sweet, signifying a sugar bomb. 



Taste - The taste was not as sweet as the nose. It was chocolatey bourbon with a dry grape presence. There were notes of leather and coffee. As it warmed, I was made to think of hydrox cookies, and their dry chocolate notes. This was definitely not an overt dessert stout. 



Mouthfeel - There was just a bit of carbonation and a slick body. 



Overall - A solid barrel aged stout that left me confused about the hype.Sep 18, 2021"

4.78/5  rDev +6%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Sent by the very generous @jvgoor3786 in a recent box of goodies. I poured from the 12oz. can into a 12oz. snulip glass.



The pour is slick dark brown like used motor oil. It leaves a small layer of creamy tan foam in it's wake. Smells like bourbon, char, ripe dark fruit and molasses. The taste is very bourbon forward followed by dark roast/coffee, burnt brown sugar, fine tobacco. There's a slight sweetness that offsets the bourbon that is wonderful. The feel is oily smooth with noticeable alcohol warmth. 



It's been a spell since I've had a straight up barrel aged stout that wasn't overwhelmed by pastry ingredients. This reminds me of the early Bourbon County and Black Note years. It holds its own and brings a pleasant plethora of sensory delight without being overwhelming. This is the closest I've come to rating a 5 in a long time. World class and something I'd hoard if I had access to it!Mar 26, 2021"

L: Black. Really black. Surprisingly thick caramel colored head that only stays around the edge of the glass. Thin ribbons of lacing that go away.



S: Bourbon, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, and wood. It's all there, and it's impressive.



T: Sweet up front, bourbon in the middle, tamed by the cherry, chocolate and vanilla. More smooth bourbon at the finish.



F: Medium to heavy body, but not as heavy as it looks. Light carbonation.

4.14/5  rDev -8.2%
look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.252020 vintage (released in 7/2020); consumed on 2/1/21



Pours an ink-black body capped with around a finger of creamy, pale mocha foam; decent head retention yields a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a minimal amount of spotty lacing holding to the walls of the glass.



Aroma opens with charry roast sporting a boozy cherry essence before a burly bourbon character takes over; burnt vanilla bean offers a slight bittersweetness over the middle, while the back end of the bouquet highlights increasingly defined notes of dark chocolate, Raisinets, and suggestions of cherry liqueur.



Taste brings forth a vivid expression of sweet, bourbon-imbued malts with some savory umami aspects; melted marshmallow, chocolate soft serve ice cream, with toasty malt tones interspersed between; sweet pipe tobacco and baked cacao over the mid-palate feed into darker brownie crust intermingling with persistent roast on the back end for a lingering bourbon barrel presence and touches of raisin past the swallow.



Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body, slick upfront and with minimal carbonation; steadily roasty through the mid-palate and mildly warming into the back end, a deft, boozy heat meshes with subtle grit and distantly chewy textures to close; a surprisingly tame delivery for a barrel-aged stout, though overwhelmingly satisfying given its plush characteristics.



Quietly unique in its extraction of the sweeter malt profile, this beer brings the notion of a cream stout to life with an amplified yet consistently roasty sweetness in tune with a pillowy body and casual warmth; balanced to near-sessionability for a brew of its ABV.Feb 02, 2021"

Pours a think used motor oil color with minimal coffee crema head. Nose is of barrel and vanilla, roasted malts, milk, minimal umami/soy.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75L: Black as pitch brew. No light passes even at the fringes of my Firestone Teku.

A finger and a half of dense camel hued head with average retention but a unique fingerprint of wide and thin splotchy lacing.



S: Soy sauce but lighter so than all soy brews I’ve encountered. This aroma is offset by burnt sugars, sweet molasses, dark roasted malts and the slightest vanilla and tobacco for a complex and mouthwatering brew. More vanilla as it warms.



T: Follows the aroma mostly, but tends sweeter than I’d hoped for. The sugars mask the complexity found on the nose.

Still quite good. Impossible that a beer rates so high on all parameters but only good on taste.



F: Highest mouthfeel rating I’ve given to a beer lacking the weight and sticky viscosity of the best BCBS years. This one is thinner but also an amazing balance of syrup, sticky, oily, and creamy. It is lighter weight perfection. You must experience.



O: I didn’t set out for a verbose review, but while so many BA Stouts fall short of my local Fremont’s, this one came outta nowhere with its complexity and simultaneous subtlety! A stellar brew on the nose especially, which deserves to be tried by stout-lovers the world over!Jun 24, 2020"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Immediately upon popping open the tab on this one I can tell I'm in for something rich and delicious. A dark liquid pours forth, Nearly jet black with a tight but creamy soft looking rich brown espresso head that lingers and lingers. Beautiful sticky lacing as well. This is gorgeous. 



Nose is again big. Creamy and slightly nutty with a seeming wood influence to the dark coffee and light spice notes. I'm getting a decent amount of creaminess as well as nuttiness, so could this be a stout with hazelnut or perhaps lactose? Smells more like nutty creamy (erm...) than lactose creamy, at least to start. 



Oily and dry and a nice high point of carbonation that helps usher the whole thing along. What it ushers in is cocoa/bakers chocolate and some further light cream. I'm leaning milk stout here, with a nod in the dark toasty side of things. Me likes. Almost kind of a coconut husk kind of thing with the nuttiness I was noting on the nose.Apr 05, 2020"

Aggressively poured in to a Samuel Smith pint glass.



Look- Black as midnight. Sizable rich mocha colored head with great retention, tons of thick lacing. No carbonation streams visible.



Smell- Caramel/toffee type malts, chocolate, fresh ground coffee, bourbon and oak, roasted nuts (praline candies in particular), licorice, toasted dark bread and dark fruits (raisins and dates), a bit of vanilla. Light spice notes.



Taste- Rich caramel malt, bourbon and barrel, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and dried dark fruits, licorice, roasted nuts, burnt sugar, light spicy hops and a bit of cherry and coconut.



Feel- Medium/heavy bodied with an incredibly smooth, pillowy creamy texture. Light bitter finish, soft carbonation on the tongue.

Deep thick inky black pour with a tall creamy bubbly head of beige. Very pretty. 



Aroma of thick, sappy bourbon barrel, deep chocolate, big molasses, heavy caramel, and suggestions of syruped figs. Wow. 



Flavor is just massive. Tons of candied pecan, figs, bourbon, maple, milk chocolate, vanilla and chocolate wafers, candy shell, caramel roll, and molasses. All wrapped up in a bourbon blanket. 



Feel is thick, sticky, hot, and burning.

Abrasive Ale

Surly Brewing

Imperial IPA

Date: 17 Dec 2021

Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent. 

Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal. 

Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank. 

The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers. 

This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing.Mar 01, 2022"

Aroma is fruity citrus deep pine resin, nose is good but not in your face big double IPA like.



Taste is definitely big on hop resin scrap your tounge bitterness. Lingering pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Flavor is just tropical fruits and citrus. Maybe I'm just expecting more dinner is world class, it isn't bad but eh not world class atleast for me.



Mouthfeel is nice and almost full the oats really help with the mouthfeel.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5This is a lovely looking brew. Golden liquid with a considerable amount of haze. Firm white head with a decent size, good retention and lots of lace. 



Nose is a delightfully malty, hoppy and enticing combination. Malt has lots of toasted grains and light sweetness. A light bit of sharp alcohol is the only hint of the abv. Hops are healthy and dank. Tropical fruits abound. Citrus cuts across and makes it quite hop forward.



Taste is super. Big malt core wraps itself around my tongue. Pilsner like and lightly sweet.Then BAM! Citrus and tropical hops flood the mouth. Hop oil and pineapple, bread and mild grain sweetness. Finish is clean and dry and shortish with lingering oil and grains. No trace of alcohol in the flavor. 



Feel is superb. How a beer this big can be this light and creamy. The malted oats really shine here. Silky swallow, crisp carbonation. Just top notch. 



This is a such a great beer. Quenching and easy drinking. You could fool yourself into seasoning it until you fall on your face. So tasty and satisfying, I can go for another, and another, and another,May 21, 2021"

Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Samuel Smith English tulip.

m: Denser side of medium, very good body and some carbonation tingle.



o: A near the top of the top 250 brew years ago, now available in my state. Great flavor presaging the coming of the NE style. Not as fruity but with more tropical danky goodness than most of the best of the old West Coast style entries.Apr 27, 2021"

It pours a rich, bright, medium golden color. Has a slight smidge of haze, but it's mostly clear. Carbo is steady, though the head is a thin layer of fine white foam, with light lacing. Has a nice aroma, with tangerine, pineapple and pithy grapefruit all present and accounted for. Body is medium to medium-plus, and it passes smoothly over the tongue.



Taste is more on the sweeter side vs. bitter.... Has peach, tangerine, pineapple, a hint of honey, a smidges of guava and passion-fruit. Has some subtle bitterness in the finish, though it is predominantly semisweet. Solid and tasty! Prosit!

For the second time in one Tree House run, we have yet another TH beer in the BA top 250! This one currently sits at #168, and #2 for Milk Stouts, just under their own Moment Of Clarity. Funnily enough, they are both Milk Stouts aduncted with coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup. Let’s crack it open and see how they differ



Pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing



The nose is very sweet and maple-forward, but there’s a delicate balance from the roast. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple syrup, vanilla, milk chocolate truffle, caramel, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light nougat



Once again in taste, there’s a lot of maple, but the balance is even more amazing here. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, toasted oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, light coconut, and dark caramel. The swallow brings notes of sweet maple, chocolate fudge, dark caramel, toasted oak, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light molasses



A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a creamy but not syrupy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but not overly sweet



In a word; wow. Maybe I’m a sucker for maple in Stouts, 2 of my all time top 10 beers are just that, but this is truly awesome. Even better than Moment Of Clarity. Tree House strikes again with this long time want of mineOct 03, 2022"

4.31/5  rDev -4.4%
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Excellent head production and good retention. Overall, an attractive beer.



Tons of maple on the nose; it's definitely the dominant characteristic, followed by coffee and the rich malt base. I don't get much chocolate standing out from the malt.



Flavor is more balanced: up front, it's a stout, through and through. The maple doesn't take long to show its presence, but it's a bit woodier and far less sweet than the nose. This is certainly amplified by the bitterness of the coffee and chocolate. The result is more in line with a breakfast beer (a la Maple Bacon Coffee Porter) than a dessert beer - which seems to be the goal, based on the description.



Maple, wood, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, cream. The flavor really grows; I wasn't blown away by the first sip, but I'm liking it more and more.



An easy trap for a beer like this is to go overboard on the sweetness. While the maple winds up being the star (as so often is the case when adding maple syrup), it's still a pretty well-balanced beer, with plenty of bitterness. It's very approachable for a beer verging on double digit ABV. It lets you know it's pretty big, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it.Oct 03, 2021"

Seems almost impossible to get FRESH Toppling Goliath here unfortunately.



Pours into my tulip a peach gold shade with a big fluffy creamy ecru head. Lots of particulates in the beer. Head is long lived and leaves fluffy sheets of lace.



Scent is citrus and tropical fruit. Soapy and floral. Papaya, guava, pineapple.



Taste is muddled tropical fruits. Citrus. Pineapple. Mangoes. Malt presence is constrained to a light pretzel note. There's a minty green note also.



Mouth is creamy with a nice weight to it.



This is a very impressive beer considering it is 3 months past its BB date. I can only imagine how great this must be when fresh.Aug 21, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5This is pure, unfiltered, and unimaginably delicious beer. 16oz can poured into a snifter at 50F. Opaque hop slurry looking like a glass of orange juice. Head is white, like soap suds, that just hang around the entire time, leaving mountains of lacing on the sides of the glass. Total hop slam to the nostrils; full on dank citrus. Taste is a spectacularly hoppy mess, with a consistency like orange juice, but with hop pulp instead of orange. Good lord this is amazingly hoppy, and full bodied, with very little alcohol to be found, as it is masked by the hop insanity. This is a pale ale? So says the can. Did they accidentally can a bunch of King Sue in the wrong cans? Nope. Picked up a 4 pack of each, and this Pseudo Sue might as well be a solid single IPA when compared to King Sue. Overall one of the best beers I have ever had.Jul 09, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 416oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.49. PKG on 1/31/2022 with a best buy date of 5/31/2022, so this is just over 3 1/2 months old.



Look: Pours a pale golden color with a lot of floaties that eventually settled. There was a nice, fluffly white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. The beer became a lot hazier after pouring the bottom of the can.



Smell: Has a pronounced citra hop aroma - lots of grapefruit peel, orange, grassy, with green bell pepper notes on the back end. Smells peppery also and has subtle cantaloupe notes also.



Taste: The taste definitely follows the nose. Strong grapefruit flavors with a moderate to high bitterness on the finish that lingers but does not overpower the palate. It's very drinkable. I think that the flavor filled out a bit also after pouring the bottom of the can.



Feel: Has light to medium body, nicely carbonated.



Overall: Solid single-hop pale ale. To me, this toes the line between a pale ale and an IPA. Personally, I would probably put this closer to IPA territory than pale ale, but I can see both opinions. Regardless, it's very delicious, highly drinkable, and accessible.May 18, 2022"

look: 3.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4Appearance: Cloudy straw orange, fluffy white head, very good retention.



Aroma: Hops forward. Citrus notes of oranges, tangerines. Tropical fruit.



Flavor & aftertaste: Citrusy & tropical fruit hops flavors. Restrained but balancing bitterness. Medium sweetness.



Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Light to moderate carbonation. Medium length finish with trailing bitterness.



Overall: I can see why this is so highly rated and popular. In short, it has a simple hoppy aroma and flavor profile emphasizing citrus & tropical fruit notes from Citra hops. It is moderately sweet with a perfectly balanced bitterness that makes it's presence known but quickly fades into the background. It has a medium body making it light enough to not be filling but beefy enough not to feel thin. I like the carbonation level which releases nicely when poured properly. You almost feel like you about to experience some hop burn, but it never got there. Tough review for me because I expect American Pale Ale to be clear to slightly cloudy visually, so I had to give it lower marks visually. But this is one excellent pale ale that I enjoyed drinking.Mar 13, 2022"

4.25/5  rDev -5.6%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Brought forth from a tap into a clear pint glass, it arrived with a modest and enduring off-white head. The color is a relatively bright orange-amber, considering how opaque it is. With it, come all the right smells of an American Pale Ale. Malt, hops both citrusy and piney, join with a hint of yeast and alcohol to make a nicely balanced, if not pungent, treat for the nose. These qualities are passed on to the taste, which agrees completely with the nose. The finish contributes a dry bitterness that augments the solid taste. There's just enough alcohol to add another layer without harming the mouthfeel. For the taste and body, there's surprisingly little glass lacing. Nothing new, but this is one good APA.Feb 17, 2022"

Smells of dark fruit, spice, caramel, and an alcoholic rye-like note.



Taste follows the nose. Intense flavour of aged dark fruit up front with a lot of spice and apricot. Sweet notes in the background of caramel and bready malt. The spicy alcohol profile is very similar to what you get on a high abv rye barrel aged ale. It's pretty intense but it fits the style and flavour profile really well. 



The mouthfeel is full bodied with quite a bit of carbonation. Kind of acidic, very smooth.



This beer is awesome overall but it's pretty far off of my favourite abbey quads. I won't get this again for a while, but I don't regret buying it, even though I paid $10 for it. Very complex beer with a ton of intense flavours that embody its style very well.Jun 22, 2022"

4.64/5  rDev +3.1%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours a deep, opaque chestnut-brown with an explosive three finger head that slowly compacts over the next 4, 5 minutes into a nice thin white cap. These beers never look worse than ‘amazing’ in a nice goblet.



Both strong and gentle, complex, and boozy aromas swirl in the glass. I’ll try to name the most prominent, they all mix and intermingle together quite well. Nutty, savoury, and slightly spicy aromas on the nose, caramel and toffee. I almost always get a bit of rum like aromas on these quads and Belgian strongs. Others get wine. I think the high abv% + whatever aroma you pick up strongest influences what you tend to associate that alcohol warmth with. For me, it’s always rum and raisins. Definite some sweet, dried dark fruits here and I primarily smell raisin and figs. Possibly some dry dark cherries. Caramel and toffee, some savoury yeasty notes here as well in the back. Some dried, toasted woody grains. With both the aroma and taste, there are so many complexities to it, I don’t think anyone can pick them all out. Everyone gets it a little bit different, which is just another aspect to this phenomenal beer.



As with all Belgian strong beers, the taste evolves significantly throughout the sip. You get the strong alcohol notes up front, and the spicy ones as well. More of that rum soaked raisin cake, delicious yeasts, a touch of cinnamon but mostly nutmeg, peppery like a touch of black pepper. In the middle it’s nicely doughy and malty, with some nice sweet dessert flavours and dried fruit coming out to play. Maybe there’s a bit of dark chocolate here too? Definitely figs, raisins, dark cherries. Woody, port-like flavours in the background as well. Little earthy, little malty on the finish. Still a bit of caramel, toffee, and general dark fruit here.



Body leans towards the fuller side, and the higher alcohol certainly makes it feel thicker. However, the high level of carbonation gives it a very creamy mouthfeel and sip. Long finish, this beer finishes more dry than anything else and mildly sweet. Not as sweet as the nose suggests — tempered by the peppery notes and the carbonation, it keeps this beer wonderfully balanced. That carbonation was surprising but has that nice gentle bite on each sip to enhance that peppery flavour. 



It’s hard for me to not write the same flowery praise for any Tripel, Quadrupel, Dark Belgian. We tend to only carry the best brewery offerings in Canada, and this is a tried and true style coming from a select batch of trappists and brewers who have been making these beers for decades (or even longer). If you’re reading this, I know I don’t really have to convince you. This is good. Really good. Foundational stuff. When you see it next, grab one for you and one for your cellar, you know you will not regret it.Mar 13, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5I've had a few really good Belgian ales before, but this one is very close to being my favorite.

Received via trade from @Providence and boy, do I owe him for this.

Poured a warm dark walnut stained mahogany color and was crowned with a beige head, albeit briefly. Almost looked too pretty to drink.

Aroma wafted politely and was full of dark fruits (Figs, raisins, dates) and sweeter stuff like caramel and toffee. The taste followed, with a few spices that held it back from the cloying sweetness stage and balanced this so ideally I couldn't think of much to improve upon. 

The date on it was about 4 months out so I suspect it was 4 1/2 years old. Still wonderful. Now I have to taste a fresh one!

The feel, well, excellent. Almost, but not quite, viscous. I still opted to drink this slowly and savor it, for it is worth savoring.

OA, amazing beer. If you get the opportunity, get it.Feb 16, 2022"

Aroma: Malty with strong dark fruit aromas, hint of alcohol.

Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied, effervescent, drying



Overall: Excellent Trappist beer. Has the characteristic champaign-like effervescence. Malt forward with darker fruit flavors, caramel. Spiciness is prominent and pepper. Good medium to full body mouthfeel. Has some balancing bitterness, but it is barely noticeable. Alcohol is noticeable, quite upfront, but it is 11% ABV. It is amazingly drinkable for a high carbonation, 10% plus ABV beer. Found no flaws in this one. Have to give it a 5 for being a world class Trappist beer.Jan 21, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Canned on 7/19/22; consumed on 8/17/22



Pours a turbid, milky honey-gold body topped with three fingers of fluffy, whote foam; good head retention yields ¾ of a finger of creamy cap, a thin, frothy collar, and slight, webby layers of taut, soapy lacing lining the walls of the glass.



Aroma brings fresh orange zest contrasting a musty lime undertone, with prickly resins and underripe mango building to candied grapefruit as peach fades atop a boggy subtext.



Taste offers ripe, waxy white grape sporting a tinge of honey upfront as notes of papaya and musty agave graze the mid-palate; subtle moss enlivened by orange zest on the back end culminates with fleshy peach trending into jackfruit density on the closing impressions.



Mouthfeel shows a medium body and moderate carbonation dispersing a taut prickle into an otherwise creamy mid-palate, where resinous grit lingers to a silky back end and balanced finish sporting a subdued bitterness.



Hearty resins amplify fresh, dank overtones to a waxy, tropical potpourri; an exceedingly stimulating profile balanced with silky, bittering edges.Aug 18, 2022"

4.59/5  rDev +1.8%
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Pours black with a dark mocha colored foam atop. Head only gets to a finger or so before bubbling away. Aroma is rich roasty, toasty, and caramely malts with big swells and waves of caramel, toffee, molasses, chocolate, and coffee. Coffee is mild, but integrated well. Bourbon hits right at the finish, notching the heat up right at the end, but not enough to push it into boozy or burning territory. Flavor profile is big roasty, toasty, and caramely malts with decadent layers of toffee, chocolate, and coffee throughout. Despite leaning into the darkness, it has playful hits of sweetness. Bourbon and char add a swell of bitterness and heat at the end, but not enough to upend the balance. Mouth feel is thick. It's full, creamy, and hearty. It's viscosity suggests a much higher alcohol percentage. Overall, a hefty, hearty stout enhanced by coffee and bourbon. It's a boozy brunch beer for those seeking to lay on the couch the rest of the day.



Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.252018 vintage, opened in 2021



Pours an oily midnight black with no head to speak of, but a lasting spider web lacing atop the liquid.



Smells of melting chocolate among toasty malts and smoky rye, together with a floral sweet, rich whipped cream impression.



Has a creamy, smooth mouthfeel, showcasing a rich and full bodied beer, together with a lower, well fitting carbonation.



Tastes of bourbon soaked, toasty coffee beans, additional char among whipped cream and lighter molasses. Has a short, sugary peak, coated up by even more whipped cream, warming spices and light coconut flakes among a flowery softness. Finishes with bitter chocolate, a pleasant currant tartness, lighter hazelnuts and a long lasting bourbon dryness, together with honey and maple syrup.



This is a great beer, featuring a gentle, well put Bourbon richness, enhanced by a smooth, versatile malt backbone.Sep 26, 2021"

4.78/5  rDev +6%
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.7516 oz can.



Pours a hazy pale gold color with a 2 finger creamy white head that has stubborn retention and leaves a halo of lacing around the glass when the stupid head finally starts to dissipate.



The aroma starts off citrusy, with loads of grapefruit, tangerine, and lemon zest. Then comes a wave of pineapple, melon, papaya, overripe mango, blueberry and strawberry. Very grainy as well. 



The flavor has a ton of pineapple, as well as grapefruit, orange creamsicle, tangerine and melon. There's a bit of papaya, mango, guava and mixed berries with a rindy finish. Very grainy, like the nose. So much going on here.



Medium-full bodied with lower carbonation. Fluffy, creamy and pillowy soft. No alcohol presence.



Well, this might be not only the best beer I've ever had from Other Half, but one of the best beers I've ever had, period. From the cornucopia of flavors to the perfect mouthfeel, this is absolutely amazing.Oct 02, 2022"

4.29/5  rDev -4.9%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25No evident canning date. Poured into an Other Half snulip glass. It pours an opaque, bright, dirty tangerine color with almost a finger of fluffy, milk-white head and thick, clinging lacing. Lots of lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, and pineapple on the nose along with floral hops. There is a good balance of sweet and tart citrus, including the aforementioned lemon, grapefruit, orange/tangerine, and pineapple, and notes of ripe melon but the malt provides a rich, earthy backdrop from the oats and wheat. Others have commented on the hop burn but I find the bitterness to be clean and manageable. The mouth feel is terrific: rich and fluffy with appropriate carbonation, and the 8.5% ABV gives it good substance without overpowering. Overall, I have a feeling that this can is past its prime. It's a fine NEIPA for sure but I can't justify the World-Class rating.Mar 12, 2022"

s: tangerines and grapefruit upfront. mango, pineapple, peaches follow. some crackers, tangy citrus zest, and some creamsicle. a hint of guava, strawberry, and kiwi towards the end as well. aroma on this is so creamy



t: like the aroma, grapefruit and tangerines upfront. some decent earthy and grapefruity bitterness is apparent immediately. creamsicles, orange juice, guava behind that. some mango sorbet and a touch of that tangy pineapple. a nice crackery note and a bit of raw hop burn on the tongue



m: medium, super fluffy mouthfeel. medium carbonation



o: awesome beer, and another example for me of why NEDIPA should be a style. this does a great job of being tropical, and getting it's sweetness from the hops - not sweet sticky malts. mouthfeel is spot on. i'd like perhaps just a little bit less burn. still great stuffJan 15, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 42018 bottle properly cellared. Viscous black pour, tiny brown collar. Smell is full and rich with the deep and dark coffee, and chocolate, the bourbon, maple and vanilla are faint. Taste is improved, starts the same as the nose with the dark coffee and chocolate, but bourbon and oak make a warming entrance quickly, providing the maple a way to creep down the spine of the beer, together it is nuanced and dark. Feel is medium thickness, lightly warm, and mostly shaped by the coffee textures. It's good, but I would take CBS any dayDec 17, 2020"

3.55/5  rDev -21.5%
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 2.5Big 750ML bottle that’ll make quite a crash in the recycling bin. Split with my wife. Because I’ve had my sugar quota for the week. 



Lab black, little to no head. Smell like an Oompa Loompa is holding my face inches from a small pond of chocolate. Overwhelming. 



Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout is sweeter than my Grandma (no, not really, nothing sweeter than Gen! Plus, she made killer buns). Wow. The cocoa. And this from a confirmed chocolate addict. All the chocolates. Vanilla shows after a good spell of warming along with a smidge of coconut. No toast. Nothing to offset the ridiculous sweetness. Full, big, but a small sample of this would have left me content. 75 minutes in & not half done. 



The barrel aged version was superior: the bourbon & oak seem to have cut the overwhelming sense of being trapped in a silo of raw sugar. Good but would be much better in small quantities.Dec 16, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5Bottled December, 2016



Color on the pour is an interesting reddish brown. Once in the glass it settles into a deep, deep brown with just the faintest of red. Almost no head, but a mocha colored ring persists. Excellent legs. 



Aroma is rich and boozy. The bourbon / barrel are both there, but so are notes of chocolate, molasses, figs and more. . Very nice smelling beer. 



As for taste, unsurprisingly the coffee has faded and I honestly can't even detect it. That said, I'm not sure it matters all that much, as what's still there is great. For my first few sips I was getting lots of barrel / bourbon, but as my palate has adjusted the depth of the beer became more noticeable. Nothing is in your face. The chocolate, roast, barrel etc. are all subtle enough that each sip leaves a slightly different impression. 



Nice light alcohol warmth and amazingly full, chewy mouthfeel. Maybe I've given a 5 on feel before, but if so, I don't know when. For my tastes, this has a perfect feel. 



Overall, while I wish I'd tried one of these fresh, it's clear that this is a very well-crafted beer that has held up well over time, even without the coffee element.Apr 17, 2022"

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a film, leaving some lacing behind



S- aroma jumps out of the glass with barrel character; bourbon, wet oak, caramel vanilla, toasted coconut and toffee. The base beer provides notes of nutty fudge, black licorice, dark chocolate, charred malt, molasses, brown sugar & leather. Also picking up a hint of orange truffle



T- sweet and malty initially, with a bit dark chocolate note, along with black strap molasses and brown sugar. Mid-palate brings out a bold barrel note, adding barrel juice, oak, caramel and vanilla. As it nears the close, notes of chocolate fudge, caramel, walnut and charred malt emerge. The linger gives more oaky bourbon and chocolate 



M- medium body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns creamy into a silky, slightly warming finish 



O- bold barrel notes are complimented by a fantastic base beer, well doneFeb 01, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75Pours night black with a beautiful light brown colored head, which slowly fades to a coating layer of lacing atop the liquid.



Smell is of spicy, toasty bourbon barrel, earthy coffee and a good amount of burned rock sugar atop.



This has a silk, lighter mouthfeel mouthfeel, featuring a heavier, yet well balanced beer.



Tastes of bakers chocolate, boozy pralines and warming, oaken bourbon among layers upon layers of milk chocolate and accompanying licorice. This gets enhanced by chocolaty, wooden coffee, which inherits a gently, well dosed sweet peak, adding to the rich malt foundation of the beer. Finishes with less roast, more whipped cream covered milk chocolate and a light dryness, resulting from burned malts and a more pronounced coffee presence. 



Sweet, smooth and well balanced - this drinks almost too easy for what it is. The coffee in this does not stand out too much on its own, but rather enriches the beer in a pleasant way.Mar 01, 2020"

2013 vintage



Damn, aging has done a little bottle of beer well. Decadent brew with aromas of vanilla bean, coffee and toasted oak, with an alcohol-warming tinge at the edge of the bouquet. Flavors are as smooth as a seven-year cellared wine (oh wait, that's basically what this is), as notes of milk chocolate, creamy lactose and oaky astringency make an eminently drinkable brew, masking all but a smidge of the alcohol. Creamy, viscous complexion is confirmed by its latte-like appearance. This is a good beer.Jan 20, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Sampling a cellar temp 500 ml bottle poured into my snifter. 2020 vintage.

The bottle is part of a swap with @Artizen, thank you!

The beer pours a pitch black color with minimal dense tan head that foams up only a little bit even after a very aggressive pour. This minimal foam fades away to the thinnest of edge layers quickly after the pour.

Aroma is dark malt, lots of bourbon, some dark chocolate and a bit of toffee. Fairly sweet and robust, but not really boozy at all and no hop profile shows up.

First sip reveals a silky smooth texture and medium to thick body. The carbonation is gentle, spacious and rolls softly across my palate.

Flavor is what I expect for style and what the nose advertises. I get some roasted malt and toffee with a bit of dark chocolate and a good boost of bourbon note. I also get molasses here and some dark fruit too. Again, no hop character, and the booze is very dangerously well hidden.

I am really enjoying this beer and find it a pleasure to drink, highly recommend this to the BBA stout crowd.Feb 15, 2021"

Bought the bottle of this during the pandemic when it was made possible to order and pick up. This beer pours a beautiful reddish purple color with a nice effervescent white head and excellent initial curtain lacing. Intense tart cherry smell and taste with warm spice flavors and a nice earthy funk. Enjoyed it very much!



Had the latest batch on 6/5/22 from tap at the brewery. The latest version lives up to previous. Detected a bit of rich vanilla as well. Really a great beer.Dec 25, 2021"

S: Immediate, cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. There is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal.

T: Surprisingly subdued, it is sour, but not brutally so, and the cherry is certainly there but I got some baking spice, what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . There are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins.

M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry.

O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. Fruited Sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not, but I will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here, I would be more inclined to buy them.Sep 04, 2021"

So excited to try this. The be had an Atrial before and it ranked up there as one of my favorite wild ales ever. Upon pouring it, it looks beautiful. Love the color. I’m super disappointed on the nose though. I get a bit of funk and cherrry, but it’s very muted. On the palette though it’s more pronounced. It has a wonderful balance of cherry but could use more bret funk for my preference. I probably like the funk more than most people though. There’s a wonderful balance of sweet and tart with the cherries too. A lovely beer overall. Probably not my top 2-3, but worth the word class ratings.May 10, 2021"

Pours a ruby red with a small white head that leaves a ring of lacing. 



Nose is of strong sweet and sour cherry, cinnamon, oak, and vanilla, floral cherry. 



Taste follows the nose with sweet cherry, cinnamon, mild oak, mild vanilla, cherry blossom, vinegar. 



Feel is light/medium body and hits the tip of the tongue with a burst of carb.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Unbelievably huge thanks to Anthony for this massive want of mine. Very excited. 



500ml bottle - b6 (Feb. '19) poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F. 



Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen. 



Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake. 



Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish. 



Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry. 



Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class.Apr 07, 2020"

A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is hazy yellow-golden with a half-finger white head that settles fast.



S: Really nice nose - a strong nose that jumps out of the glass. Dank, green, raw hops and a lot of tropical fruit: mango, some pineapple, papaya. 



T: Follows the nose, with mango, pineapple, citrus pith and peel, and a bite of leafy green hops. White grape skins as I take a few more sips (makes me wonder if Nelson hops are in the house tonight - wait . . . I see that's not the case, must be the Mosaic and Galaxy hops instead. . . ). Alcohol is noted as heat on the back of the palate. Good balance, with a nice bite of bitterness at the end, which lingers. 



M: Juicy in feel, call it medium in heft/weight. Somewhat juicy up front, but lightly dry and chalky into the aftertaste. A bit of booziness. 



O: Very good. A little too much alcohol, but otherwise a very well done brew.Sep 16, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.53 months old. Can to wine glass.



L: Pours an opaque orangeish yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.



S: Ripe orange and grapefruit with some piney, woody hints. A bit of mango as well.



T: Orange, mango and peach. A bit piney, grassy and herbal. Both hoppy and malty. Not as sweet as its smell. Minimally zesty and a bitter finish.



F: Full and creamy. Low carbonation.



O: Nice East Coast/ West Coast hybrid IPA uniting fruity citrus notes with piney and grassy hints. As always, great craftsmanship from HF.Aug 01, 2022"

L -- Hazy golden orange in the glass with the usual fluffy HF head that lasts and retains wonderfully

S -- Mango sorbet, orange juice, yellow grapefruit zest, lightly creamy oat malt, and a light berry note 

T -- Wave of pithy yet creamy citrus pith, citrus flesh, and dried blueberry, followed by a moderate earthy bitterness that is pronounced but rounded. Light malty sweetness makes for a nice tapering finish that continues to be lightly bitter

F -- Soft, fluffy, drinkable

O -- A hair more bitter than my favorite S&S variants. Still fantastic, as expected

Beer pours a moderately hazy yellow-gold, big white head of foam, scant lacing. The smell of Mosaic hits upon pouring, with big notes of sweet berry, along with citrus, tropical fruits and a touch of pine. Taste follows. Another immaculate construction. Hill beer is magical.Apr 08, 2022"

Hazy color but with a perfect 1 finger rich white head with excellent retention. Nose is pine, grapefruit, starfruit, and pineapple. Fresh, juicy, and grassy all at the same time. Beer opens pineapple, grapefruit, and starfruit. Grassy in the middle with a rounded, juicy body. Soft, pillowy towards the end with more grapefruit and starfruit notes. Bone dry at the finish. Extremely balanced. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Bone dry on the palate and quenching and soft going down with the same, dry finish. Perfectly drinkable. 



The flavor is there but the best thing about this beer is the body. Perfection!Nov 07, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5L: Hazy, pale straw yellow with a creamy white head and good lacing.



S: Mango and papaya with a touch of pine resin, not over the top but still very aromatic. The malt is subtle but is combines with the yeast to create a subtle fresh baked bread note.



T: Very mellow bitterness, big ripe mango, citrus and pine flavors with a clean malt backbone. The yeast seems to be contributing some fruitiness as well.



F: A dry, moderate body and a crisp, low-carbonated finish.



Overall: An excellent NE-Style IPA that showcases mosaic hops very nicely. This beer is all about hop flavor just as any beer in the style should be.Aug 08, 2020"

4.76/5  rDev +4.6%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.



This has a nearly perfect vanilla aroma to it, just so authentic, decadent, but not overly cloying, with dark chocolate, bourbon, dried black cherry, and coffee.



The vanilla treatment here is nearly perfect - reminds me of something like Vanilla Rye in its prime (not now). It's got that cake-like sweetness with a touch of dried cherry, just super authentic and not at all artificial. The base stout is super chocolatey, with some roast and a touch of coffee like bitterness, with some caramel and oak on top of it from the barrel.



This is thick bodied, sweet, decadent, but not overly so, with no booziness, and a very creamy smooth finish.



It's nice to see a simple take on a pastry stout done so well these days - sometimes all it takes is the expert use of one flavor.Feb 23, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4January 1st, 2016 - Also kicking off 2016 is a beer from almost a decade ago: the 2007 Cantillon Lou Pepe. Our assumption is that this is perhaps a little long in the tooth, even for a mythically legendary beer like this, but I have high hopes and great trust in the Belgian craftsmen who have honed this recipe through generations. And it seems that my trust was well allocated, because the smell is absolutely beautiful. Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength. But the taste is spicier, and while it borrows some of the chocolate from the nose, it expresses more like a mole with that kick. Absolutely fascinating, and delicious, this has aged quite wonderfully.Mar 18, 2020"

Brewers Notes: Collaboration with J. Wakefield Brewing



We took our original J. Wakefield collaboration Affogato Imperial Stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our Hudson Road barrel house. Affogato Imperial Stout is inspired by a few of our brewers' favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) Barrington's affogato.



Barrel Aged Affogato Imperial Stout is decadent, rich and full. Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. Barrel Aged Affogato has a full, satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream, hot cocoa, rich brownie batter, with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon.



MALT: American 2-Row Barley, Crystal 120, Flaked Oats, Black Malt, Chocolate Malt, Munich Malt, White Wheat Malt, Brown Sugar, Dark Candied Syrup, Lactose

HOPS, ETC: Columbus, Barrington and Mostra Coffees, Madagascar Vanilla Beans



On tap at Trillium Canton, 5oz snifter , black motor oil , thin dark brown big bubbled layer quickly settles to a ring 



Aroma is cocoa, brown sugar, bourbon, and yes brownie batter



Taste is bourbon, cocoa, brownies, coffee



Fizzy mouthfeel , rich, decadent , 13.8% abv, this is a sipper

4.45/5  rDev -2.4%
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours a dark orange with a foggy transparency. One finger of off-white foam fizzes up top, dissipating quickly. Aroma is tart and abbreviated. It hits peach right up front, but it's soft. Stone, lemongrass, oak, green grapes, and grass all add some depth for a clean, playful smell. Flavor profile is delightful, with sweet peach right out front. Peach is mild, never commanding the lead. Accents of white wine, stone, faint pear, oak, and lemongrass establish the rest of the flavor profile. It starts out tart, leaning into sour at the end. It also finishes with a more acidic bite than the start. Mouth feel has a bubbly start, but soft finish. Thickness is medium. Overall, peach is really pleasant, and compliments the underlying beer well. It posses just enough tartness to tighten up the jaw, but not enough to wreck the palate. 



Served in a 12oz snifter from a 750mL bottle. Batch #2. Reviewed from notes.Jan 14, 2022"

The beer pours very little head and the beer itself is a dark brown color with a bourbon like appearance.



The smell is good. It has a nice mix of a sweet alcohol note and sweet hazelnut.



The taste still has the hazelnut note but the chocolate is more forward and dominates the taste alongside the alcohol note.



The feel is good. It has a heavy body with very little carbonation and a slight burn at the end.



Overall, a good beer worth getting and drinking fresh instead of holding it for a while.Jan 23, 2022"

4.45/5  rDev -1.3%
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours a very dark brown, or more so, it's black with brown shining through the edges. Its a blood-burgundy color with a clear transparency when direct sunlight pierces it. Head is a finger of khaki-caramel foam after a slow pour, but it fizzles out quickly. Aroma is raisins, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate and roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty and caramely malts. Heat is seeping through pretty heavy with a whollop of bourbon booze at the back. Flavor profile is raisins, figs, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate, molasses and syrup with hearty roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely and bready malts. It's thick, thick and thick. Drinking a boozy cookie. Bourbon adds heat that seems in and lingers long after the malts wash away. A touch of char adds a little grounding bitterness for the sugary initiation. Mouth feel is thick, sticky, velvety and chewy. Overall, thick and boozy with a lot of complexities. It's super rich and full, which is what you'd imagine out of an 20% ABV beer.

Nose is soap, oak, lemon, and a tart hop and citrus bite. Incredibly lively and aromatic and really tickles the tongue. Beer opens pear, citrus, a touch of lime, and lemon zest. The wine barrels are apparent towards the middle and end and lend a nice tart, oaky character. A slight hop bitterness seeps in at the end. Finishes lemon zest, oak, and wood. Delicious. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate and almost airy going down. Super drinkable with a clean, slightly dry finish. Incredibly drinkable. 



One of the most quaffable beers I've had in a long time. Absolutely delicious.Dec 28, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.2512 oz. bottle, marked 07/27/19, sampled 05/09/21. A little long to wait, bought it off the shelf 3 weeks ago, so the brewer takes any hits on aging, they left it there for purchase. 



Appearance: Black glass, thin halo of tan bubbles, no lacing.



Aroma: Heavy vegetative chili note, burned barrel, some underlying malt sweetness.



Taste: Medicinal alcohol, green pepper, some sweetness comes in deep into the taste, a little coffee in the finish. Hard to get many ""beer"" flavors out of this, even imperial stout flavors. Some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit.



Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, low, almost flat carbonation, little oily in the finish but pretty clean.



Overall: I love Prairie bombs, I've enjoyed a lot of the variations, this one not so much. I think all the additions overwhelm the yummy base beer, and it just comes across as a little gimmicky. The vegetable note really throws me. Maybe this one sat too long, the date code is all but invisible on the bottle.May 09, 2021"

4.25/5  rDev -5.8%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25On tap - this is the July 2019 batch, so 15 months old.



Pours jet black with a super thin tan head around the circumference of the glass. No lacing. 



Smell is rum and chocolate upfront, with coffee kicking in just a little bit after. The booze is strong on the nose, but a bit of vanilla is there to balance it. 



Taste follows the nose. The booze sting is minimal considering the ABV. Good balance between the sweet vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. The spices and coffee combine for an earthy finish that doesn’t last longer than it should.



Feel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. It doesn’t stick much or leave a thick residue on the tongue, which for me sets it apart a bit from other Prairie stouts. 



Overall, quite good. I had a tough time assigning numbers to this one, so I looked back through my previous ratings on various stouts, and eventually decided that I had to give this one 4.25 straight through. It’s not the best, but far from the worst, and very consistent across the board.Oct 15, 2020"

Bottle to snifter. Bottled in July 2019, so about 13-14 months old.



Labor Day weekend picnic.



LOOK: thick oily black, small medium brown head. 

AROMA: coffee, cocoa, rum and vanilla very nice. 

TASTE: cocoa. Coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper kick is just right. Very tasty.

FEEL: full bodied, light carbonation, sticky on the tongue which allows the pepper to linger just nice.



Very special stout. Glad I have 2 more of these to age since in general I've found rum BA to need a bit more time than Bourbon BA to mellow out.



Probably my favorite Prairie now.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Pours a hazy golden kinda with a cantaloupe flesh texture. White head. Citrus, marijuana, and a little pineapple. This is a little more citrusy and dank than the raw sugar can delight I get from DDH Double Mosaic Dream, an all time Other Half beer for me. Regardless, this is a good one. It's soft. Possibly a bit more pulpy than I'd want as I do get some vegetal hop character on the back end. Much inferior to DDH Double Mosaic Dream.Sep 19, 2022"

L: Pours a hazy dark yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Plenty of floaters.



S: Ripe tropical fruits paired with candied citrus fruits. Mainly mango, pineapple, tangerine and a bit of melon.



T: Pretty much tastes as it smells. Probably even a tad sweeter. Minimally zesty and slightly bitter. 



F: Full, smooth and creamy. Low carbonation.



O: Very good single hop IPA that showcases the Mosaic hop variety in a great way. The tropical sweetness is balanced very nicely by the slightly bitter and zesty notes. Quite creamy thanks to the oats and lactose.Aug 29, 2022"

A: Pours hazy golden amber with a creamy off white head that settles to a firm layer and laces beautifully. 



S: Jumps out of the glass with bright citrus, juicy tropical and stone fruit, a little pine, faintly grassy, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness. 



T: Big tropical and stone fruit, passion fruit, mango, lychee, pineapple, peach, apricot, guava, and a hint of blueberry, bright citrus, lemon lime and tangerine, crisp pine, biscuity malt, caramel sweetness, and a touch of lactose. 



M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, soft on the palate, just a touch of hop burn warmth, super drinkable for 8.5%.



O: Holy crap. I don't think I've ever had a Mosaic beer like this. They pulled out some amazing flavors. Super clean, great intensity, maybe a touch on the sweet side, but everything pops. I'm beyond stoked I got to try this.Jun 11, 2022"

Pours a cloudy orange-yellow color medium bodied off white colored head that laces the glass a bit as it fades. Smells of tangerine, orange, grapefruit and a sweet cream aroma at the end, like a tangerine creamsicle. Taste is sweet but not overly sweet with citrusy tangerine and a sweet cream flavor, again like a tangerine creamsicle with a slight bitterness at the backend. It's smooth, rich, nicely carbonated, an excellent beer.May 09, 2022"

Dark, mostly opaque reddish brown, still somewhat see through, tan head.



Raisin, boozy, maple, toffee, oak, fig jam on the nose. Taste follows, but with some coffee bitterness to go with the fig, raisin, clove, toasted sugar, chocolate.



Probably best barleywine I’ve ever had, boozy but not over powering, somehow everything seems in place (where I often find barley wines to be unbalanced in one way or another)Feb 20, 2022"

Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, cherry and oak. Really sweet and malty smelling. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some raisin, fig and chocolate flavors. It's sweet tasting but not overpowering at all. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and easy to drink with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. If you're into English style barleywines then definitely pick this one up, I'm glad I did!Jan 21, 2022"

11.3 % ABV. Firestone Walker Brewing, Paso Robles, CA.



Dark mahogany-hued, slim white-ish head.



In the nose: Big, boozy barleywine aromas, popping out the wazoo. All the earmarks of a classic big ol' barley-wine. Ablaze with all the the raisin and fig, the woody character, the deep malty, chocolatey, tobacco and leather notes.



In the mouth: here's where it's all delivered, right on the palate. More big, more booze, massive malt, plenty of bourbon, vanilla, cherry, and all the deep, devilish dark fruits aplenty. Yum a dum, dum. I could have sat on this another five years, but I just had to try it now.



One of the best barleywines I've tasted in a good long while. Mmm, hmmmJul 05, 2021"

Palate Contaminants: other beer, plus a nice fatty cheese



Medium brown color and off-white head. Lacing is present, but doesn't last too long.



First smell that hits me is flint. (That's... odd.) Scored sugar. Roasted pecans, honey-covered. This isn't the first time I've had this brew, but I don't remember any of this. 



Maybe I should've downed this one and bought a fresher bottle to review because it has been one of my favorites, even if I haven't had it in years. I mean, none of this rings the ol' olfactory bell for me. Still, I rate the first bottle/can that's possible for me, so if there's wide dispersion in the quality, then it is what it is.



On the taste (of this bottle), if herbal rum were a thing, this would be it, right on down to the alcohol presence. And I suppose you can kick in a little lactose, butter variety. It's much more vegetative than I remember, too. It's more bitter than most FW barrel-aged offerings. Sweetness is moderate. (There's none of the savoriness that I remember.)



At least the build quality is still there. Good, fine carbonation, and there's a really pleasant woody/nutty aftertaste. Good medium-heavy weight. The overwrought alcohol presence is the only detriment.



I need to revisit this one.Feb 21, 2021"

4.54/5  rDev +0.7%
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5I poured a 12oz. bottle into a 20oz. weizen glass and have ended up with two fingers of beautiful, frothy, dark tan foam. It slowly recedes but does not disappear as advertised! Typical stout look, very dark, one could say black. There is very thick lacing left all the way down the glass as I consume this one.

The aroma is malt first, sweet chocolate, and a little of coffee. 

The sip offers a bit of sweetness, then it is quickly covered with the roasted coffee bitter bite and a bit dry to the finish.

There is not an alcohol bite here, but this one is a belly warmer. This is very thick creamy stuff with very light carbonation.

Good stuff, I do not take much time between sips, this one keeps calling me back. Be careful, at 8.3ABV this bowl of oatmeal may sneak up on you!Aug 18, 2022"

Beer itself looks like black coffee, no light may be permitted to pass through. Coffee and chocolate present on nose, coffee more so. Sweet bready characterstics as well. In flavor the coffee is much stronger, almost overpowering but not too extreme. Finishes long and remains on lips. Nice and creamy feel, when swishing, movement of liquid is difficult to perceive, almost envelops the tongue. Pretty nice, wish I liked coffee.Aug 07, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Drank early this morning, and wrote this on a napkin. Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $4.00. Poured into a nonic pint glass.



L - Motor oil brownish-black, with a fluffy and viscous two-finger khaki head. Lacing is excellent.

S - Reminds me of the coffee from Dynamite Roasting. Bittersweet chocolate. Roasted oat.

T - Matches nose, with a bit more complexity. Definite ethanol presence, but the flavor of it never comes through (a good thing). Super toasty. Bittersweet throughout. More coffee-heavy than chocolate-heavy.

F - Thick. Heavy. Full-bodied, with little carbonation (if any). A sipper.

O - Probably not the best idea to have this for breakfast. A prime example for an oatmeal stout. Definitely recommend trying this one, but I won't purchase one again (not too into heavy beers).Jul 10, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Pours almost black with a thick cream colored head that diminishes with time but never disappears.



Aroma of rich coffee with a hint of dark chocolate.



The taste is coffee tempered with a splash of milk and sweetened with dark chocolate just enough to take the edge off on top of a bed of dark roasted grains.



Every sip is rich and full.



Overall, it's a great coffee stout - one of the best, the benchmark by which other coffee stouts are judged. It hits the perfect coffee / stout balance to highlight the coffee without making it taste like you're drinking black coffee and with a rich, dark stout as the base that holds up nicely to the coffee. Other coffee stouts often have too little coffee flavor, or sometimes too much, but this one nails the balance.Jun 17, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.512 oz bottle

Glass: snifter

Serving Temp: room temperature (approx 71 F)





Look: Black with huge 2.5-finger khaki head that pretty much fills out the snifter. The head dissipates slowly to leave a slight but consistent khaki coating. Lacing is all the way down the glass.



Smell: Dark-roasted Columbian coffee with a large dose of bittersweet chocolate.



Taste: Pretty much the same as it smells. Coffee. Lots of coffee. With notes of bittersweet chocolate and some earthy bitterness. The coffee and earthiness linger into the aftertaste. The alcohol is not noticed.



Feel: Creamy and smooth with medium body.



Overall: A fantastic stout that has been one of my favorites since I first had it back in 2013 or 2014. I try to keep a couple on hand at all times. This one is a bit more bitter than I remember, but that's likely because this is the freshest Breakfast Stout that I have had in a while. I have mostly been having them at 1+ years old. At that age, the chocolate takes center stage and the coffee is the supporting act.Mar 20, 2022"

Pours a hazy pale gold color with a finger of creamy white head. Modest retention. Leaves some splotchy lacing around the glass.



The aroma is exploding with notes of pineapple, mango, stone fruit, and fresh mixed berries. There's a bit of melon, grapefruit and orange as well.



The flavor follows the nose with loads of melon, mango and pineapple, candied peach rings, blueberry, orange creamsicle, and grapefruit. 



The feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A little slick and oily. Alcohol is mostly well hidden.



Overall, this is an excellent NEDIPA. It takes all the best qualities of the mosaic hop and completely amplifies them. It drinks about as it should for 8.5%.Aug 15, 2022"

4.44/5  rDev -1.8%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Poured honey orange - completely opaque and crowned with an almost white foam head ; very nice in terms of NEIPA.

The aroma is potent; and for me that's something. Fruit forward, but instead of heavy citrus I get melon and stone fruit, maybe some light pineapple and the expected hop dankness, though I had to 'look' for it. Almost hidden.

The taste is really nice. For the ABV, way too easy to gulp - I tried not to but a couple got the better of me. Smooth, almost soft, the melon and fruit play dominate roles here, a noticeable malt presence (at least I think that's what it is) and a firm stop by the hops bite before we go into juice territory. Really tasty.

The feel is appropriate to the style and without any 'bits' that seem to be always present in hazy beers. Soft is a word that came to mind, smooth another. Not pulpy, but full bodied. Very quaff-able.

OA, a solid DNEIPA and one I would be very happy to drink on a regular basis.Jan 14, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25Looks pretty good from the can for the style; pours the exact color of Gatorade citrus cooler, full 2"" had with decent retention and leaves big chunks of lacing. Nose explodes from the can with some strong diesel, resin, grapefruit juice and oil, a little grain. Taste doesn't back up the big aroma, but it's still solid - melon, tropical fruit, OJ, light hop spice and bitterness. Nothing mind-blowing, but nothing objectionable.

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the citrus and tropical fruit, followed by some berry and dank notes. Light bitterness. Finishes with lingering citrus



M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. On the smooth, fluffy side



O: A great DDH DIPA that is extremely easy to drink. A citrus and tropical fruit juice bomb. Definitely worth checking outNov 26, 2021"

4.59/5  rDev +1.5%
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75In terms of haze bombs, this beer is about as attractive as they come. Good head production and retention; excellent lacing. Body is a hue somewhere around mango flesh, hazy but not pulpy, and opaque except in the thinnest portions of the glass.



Nose is bold, strong, and bursting with juicy hop notes. Mango, peach, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and a slight dankness.



Super juicy on the palate, really delivering notes of papaya and mango - and very little else, but in the best possible way. Moderate bitterness (low for an IPA), and a soft, semi-sweet pale doughy malt base that really amplifies the juiciness.



Near perfect mouthfeel, on par with Tree House (the best in the NE IPA game, in my opinion). Creamy and soft, yet with plenty of bite; high-medium to light-full body, with excellent (dangerous) drinkability despite the high ABV.



This beer is the real deal. Absolutely superb.Nov 22, 2021"

look: 2.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5A peanut sized chunk of something floating at the surface in the neck of the bottle was visible before even popping the cap. Upon opening and pouring the beer into a snifter, the chunk remained at the surface which shifted to the bottom of the bottle mid-pour, so I was able to pour the last dregs into a smaller glass where the tan clump plopped out. It was actually hard to the touch as I plucked it from the surface of the beer. My concern began to grow because these Florida pastry stouts usually only have small flakes of more dispersed coconut lipids, which melt instantly and have almost no feel to them. Thankfully, just before my flashbacks of mouse skull chicken McNuggets fully manifested, it did begin melting in the palm of my hand.



Anywho, the body is viscous black with other minor spots of oils surfacing after the burnt mocha blanket quickly disappears to nothing at all.



Smell is Butterfinger with vanilla bean white chocolate and hints of caramel corn. As it warms, charred mocha coffee and brownie crust emerge. The aroma is hypnotizing.



Taste is decadent and a little boozy as the apple brandy barrel makes its presence known, adding sharp oaky liquor notes to the extravagant flavors of coconut filled pâte à choux with chocolate ganache. The body is just thick enough to dampen the barrel to tolerable levels of booze, allowing for additional notes of cinnamon coffee and vanilla custard to surface. The finish is semi-sticky and substantially warming all the way down.May 30, 2019"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.52013 vintage; consumed on 3/23/2022



Pours a stunning pitch-chestnut, an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly half-finger of pale tan head forms, slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap, expansive, frothing collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.



Aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum, refining focus to fig, subtle caramel, and toffee over time as an evocative, dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet; bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close.



Taste opens to layers of sugar plum, raisin, dates, and bits of brown sugar, growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the mid-palate; oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end, while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing.



Mouthfeel shows a medium body, dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a low-lying carbonation; smooth, wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague, burgeoning oxidation into mid-palate, followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end, with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish.



Belying most any sense of experiencing time and age, this is a rich, comprehensive American barleywine; a deft composition of ultra-bold fruits, calm barrel inflection, and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming, classic apex of the style.Mar 24, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Vintage 2015. I was super excited to finally land one of these, particularly an older bottle - it has aged quite wonderfully. The pour is quite a lot darker and more opaque than I'd anticipated. The barrel and light caramel are pungent. Zero sign of oxidization. I really like this beer.Jun 12, 2020"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 | overall: 416 April 2020 - Beer #70 - BA Top 250 Alert!



Corona Day #35



I'm back, baby!



Appearance: 4 - looks like a standard barleywine, but a bit darker and redder. It was pretty clear on the pour but almost completely opaque in the glass.



Nose: 4 - smells like a barleywine on some barrel. A bit fruity. Nothing special so far.



Taste: 4 - still nothing special. It's definitely a very nice barleywine, but I'm not sure why it's so highly regarded.



Mouth: 5 - thick, chewy, and round. A very well-crafted brew.



Overall: 4 - a very fine offering, but not anything I'd write home about. My wife would find it very odd to find a hand-written note about a good but not great BA barleywine.



Be safe!

Leather-mahogany in color, viscous complexion dampens any attempt at a head. 

Nose is buttery bourbon, floral malts, burnt sugar and a good dose of oak. It’s flavors follow, with a lot more boozy warmth at the front of the sip. 



Super tasty, smooth barleywine. From my understanding this was almost an accident, and it’s not quite as tasty as I remember it before Green Flash took things over, but still.Nov 13, 2019"

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Rose-copper body is quite nice, hazy, forming essentially no head even with an aggressive pour.

Mild, sharply tart, red fruit aromas of raspberry, cherry; light funk, light lemon juice.

At first the near absence of carbonation is a put off, but there is a very fine, prickly feel, and it ends up doing the job; flavour is appropriately sour, pleasantly puckering, balanced by a light fruity sweetness - like red currants more than anything; have to use your imagination to get a clear sense of raspberry, it's very subtle; there is a faint mustiness and oakiness; long, very dry finish, enticing, lightly sticky.



Give this a chance past the first few sips and you'll be rewarded. Bright and tart, with a refined and subtle effervescence and fruit character - the latter a disappointment for me, as I love raspberries.Jan 01, 2022"

Really enjoyed this, murky red raspberry color. Not the most attractive beer on the planet but the look underlies the fruit inside. I wouldn't call it overly acidic, more tart and chock full of fruit with lasting tarty raspberries. It's not as ""in your face"" as some raspberry wilds can be, but it's not as delicate as others are - this one is all about the thick fruit look, feel and taste. Cheers!Oct 14, 2021"

4.35/5  rDev -3.8%
look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25Pours crystal clear, dark ruby with almost purple hues. 2 fingers of dense pink tinged head builds and hangs around forever. An essentially perfect appearing beer. Aroma has a huge minerality, only mild lactic tartness, subtle pungent funk, not much fruit. Taste is burnt plastic like funk, some bitterness, moderate tart sourness, blueberries are subtle. I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons. It’s very clean, crispy even, with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. Overall, a very nice beer. Is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it? The short answer is probably no, but hell it was fun anyways.

It is unique and different yet similar to the best Lambics with its rich and tart flavors.

Pours into my tulip glass a turbid opaque pineapple juice shade with a creamy bright white head. Fluffy sticky lace.



Scent is pineapple, grapefruit, mango and citrus with some pine resin.



Taste is tropical fruit - mango, papaya, pineapple. Citrus - lime, oranges, grapefruit. There is a hint (just a hint) of pine resin. Some green melon. Seems like a touch of alcohol esters.



Mouth is oily and heavier than medium.



OK, finally tried this reasonably fresh. Very good. Would I rate it 100? Nope. But certainly a very well made and delicious double IPA.Sep 03, 2022"

The juicy beer bomb is extremely tasty. The mouthfeel has some bitterness with all that juice and this is just amazing beer. Never pass it up. $22 4-pakSep 01, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5a: super hazy burnt orange copper color. a hint of creamy yellow in here as well. poured a 1.5 finger off-white head that fades pretty quick



s: orange juice, tangy pineapple, tangerines. creamsicle, passionfruit, and lots of kiwi. some sweetness and peach ice cream



t: oranges, and loads of pineapple. creamy mango sorbet and a touch of raw hops and alcohol. some sugary sweetness that tastes like caramelized orange slices. some honey crackers in the background and a kiss of peach.a little bit of guava in here too



m: super fluffy, medium mouthfeel with a bit of sugary stickiness. carbonation is moderate



o: very solid beer here. I think this boarders on NEDIPA territory with some of the sweetness it's giving off. it's very well-harmonized and quite smooth, even though there's a touch of raw hops in here. Not sure I'd score it 100 here, but it's delicious and dangerous. aroma could pop a bit more too IMOAug 20, 2022"

Smell is of sweet citrus, hop, melon, and some toasted malts.

Taste is excellent, much more balanced that I was expecting. Big citrus and melon flavors balanced out by a very good toasted malt foundation.

""Double India Pale Ale."" ~$21 USD per 4 pack plus tax.



Leans too heavy into tropical territory for my taste (think warm pineapple and dried mango), yet still lacks the assertiveness I'd expect in a true IIPA. A bit warmly boozy to boot, lacking in the drinkability department compared to something like Pliny the Elder or Exponential Hoppiness.



Not Toppling Goliath's finest effort, nor is worth its hefty ~$5/can pricetag - but it's a decent brew for what it is. Not better for not having been filtered, for what that's worth.

Smells of slightly dank grassy hops with citrus and pineapple.



Tastes of tart grapefruit, lemon, pineapple and honeydew melon with a lightly styptic hop bitter finish.



Medium light body with light prickly carbonation. Brut mouthfeel.



This is an edgier take on the classic King Sue. Tarter and bitterer but still juicy complex and drinkable.

Bottle to snifter. Thanks DC for sharing.



LOOK: jet black, medium creamy beige head, excellent retention with creamy lacing. 

AROMA: bacon first, then maple takes over. Roasted malt and coffee sneak in in patches. Smells like breakfast as Jen says. Just fantastic. 

TASTE: maple and coffee on the forefront, nice sweet and savory mix. 

FEEL: Silky smooth, hint of astringency in finish. 



Wow. Very impressed with this all around, especially the aroma. 



Must seek out more as well as the other similar variants.

Strong maple syrup nose; faint whiff of smoke. Flavors of maple, coffee, sweet toffee and caramel candy base; lite roast, char. Full body, slick feel; very little warmth for 9.5%; moderate minus carbonation. Overall the maple has held up well; I could smell the maple wafting from the glass at least a foot plus away; not too adjuncty; the bacon is more a liquid smoke taste, but the dominant taste and aroma is Mrs. Butterworth’s. Funky Buddha excels at flavored pastry stouts, and this beer is one of its best.Sep 05, 2019"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam that retains really well. Aroma is heavy maple syrup and coffee with robust notes of roasty, toasty, bready malts and spry vanilla beans just beyond. It smells like a fresh slice of toast, dressed and drenched by maple syrup, while a roasty, steaming cup of coffee sits just aside. Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency. Overall, a thick and sugary beer, that while it lands more in the dessert beer category, does present itself exceptionally well as balanced and filling.

4.15/5  rDev -8.2%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Pours light hazy orange, half-inch head with moderate lacing. Nose is mango, passionfruit, fruit punch, and very light resin. Taste has light tropical sweetness, light pine and resin, with a pleasant bittering aftertaste. The finish is also on the dry side, while the mouthfeel, though not thin, isn't as silky soft as other TH NEIPAs. Overall, a nice, balanced NEIPA that stands out among other offerings.Mar 13, 2022"

On the lighter side, as an IPA rather than a DIPA, but packed a ton of flavor in there. The smell in particular was impressive - just a powerful, appetizing aroma. The mouthfeel was a tad thin for my taste, but otherwise, a deliciously bitter and juicy hazy IPA.Nov 02, 2020"

T-Sweet upfront with alcohol coming through quite assertively

O-Can was good, but this review needs to consider the fresher version at the brewery which was outstanding…

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.512oz - 2022 version. Glugs out black with a rim of mocha head. Smell is the chocolate, coffee and bourbon, in that order, then the order reverses as it warms. The taste is lots of tasty bourbon barrel heat, coffee bitterness, and sweet milk chocolate. As it warms it takes on a french toast / maple scent and taste, some subtle dark fruit... But no any rasins or dry leaves. Surprisingly well carbonated, suitable for aging... Gonna go back and grab anotherSep 27, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.2512oz bottle. Label identifies this as '2022' product.

Black colored body, with an extremely thin dark mahogany back lit edge. 1-1/2 mocha brown head, which settles back to an interrupted cap with an active surface. Leaves a couple of thin strings of lacing.

Aroma of roasted barley malt, dark coffee, and dark chocolate. Has vanilla and sweet bourbon.

Taste has bourbon drenching all the flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and dark coffee. Has some expression of dark cherry. Chocolate first and then coffee. The bourbon, with its vanilla, cover everything and extend far into the aftertaste.

Seems like a thin mouth feel at first, but thickens as the body is held in the mouth. Slight coating after each sip. Noticeable alcohol burn on the tongue. Supportive carbonation.

This is a great sipping brew, similar to a slow sipping whiskey. Savor each sip to get the full expression.Jul 31, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.25Bought from bottle craft in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego. $8.5 for a 12 oz bottle



A&S: Appearance looks pretty bland. No real head or lacing. The speaks of the head that are there, are brown. The aroma is pretty amazing. Powerful bourbon, sweet dark chocolate, toasted malts, and some coffee.



T&M: Taste is pretty tasty. Slightly bitter, sweet syrup, caramel tones in the finish. Unfortunately, there are some downsides to the taste in my opinion. I have been getting this with stouts for a while now, and I definitely, get it with this beer, but soy sauce is a part of the taste. Fantastic feel. Super rich texture, almost creamy. Carbonation adds a tiny kick, but not enough to take away from the milky tones.



Overall: I liked this beer. It was worth a try, but it falls into the category of, worth a try, but won't buy again.Jul 03, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25So this is a George Burns beer - we are talking 100 here and stuff. Now, to be honest, I don’t know much about old George; but the fact that he made it to the ripe old age of 100 is pretty dandy in my book. Meanwhile, a beer that’s rated 100 on BA is pretty wild too. Coming full circle, I’m feeling it. Barrel Aged Speedway might not be as cool as some old dude who smoked cigars a good deal of his life and lasted so long, but it’s like the cool dude at your local Elks Lodge who smashes at Shuffleboard and randomly buys you a beer because he’s cool like that.

4.49/5  rDev -0.7%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.512 ounce bottle, 2022 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla, and dark chocolate. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some oak, dark bready and burnt/charred malt flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich, coating and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a pretty good straight up barrel aged version of a classic imperial stout, really liked this one a lot! Speedway Stout is a great brew to begin with, and AleSmith didn't mess up the barrel aged version! Wish I would have bought more of this one, I know I'll buy more of it if I get the chance to!Jun 11, 2022"

Really nice looking pour, thick'n chewy almost black, a small tan head that's gone in a flash, some lingering bubbles at the edge. Snot maker detects some coffee, chocolate, roasted barley, maybe a bit of vanilla and bit of whiskey. Taste buds get, chocolate, coffee and toffee. Nice creamy mouthfell, a very easy drinker, abv is hardly noticeable.Jun 06, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Just got some bottles in via delivery, was itching to try... and i'm not at all disappointed.



This is the 2022 edition, 13.3% ABV... pours an opaque deep dark brown with quickly receding bubbles, reminded me so much of a cola... The nose is of deep sweet malts and barrel wood, coffee, cocoa, chicory... Taste delivers the promise on home, with those sweet malts and barrel leaching, tangy vanillin, brick choco, cooled coffee... not so ""hot"" in alcohol burn... Nice, comforting and appealing feel in the mouth, on the tongue and in the swallow, deep but not overly sticky. Very enjoyable and i'm sure i will be developing a real craving for the remainder of this stash.



EDIT: I'd pit this against the venerable Parabola any day.May 12, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.252021-12-17

12oz can served in a footed pilsner glass. No date that I can see. Received in a LIF associated with NBS BIF #14 from @Whyteboar.



Pours black, opaque, thick-looking but not syrupy, with a fairly small but fairly persistent head. Smell is extremely rich, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dates, tons of anise.



Taste is super chocolatey, lots of vanilla, anise is more on the back end, hoppy/roasty bitterness coming a bit after that. Building up, giving me burnt toffee character.



Mouthfeel is medium to thick, bit of a chalky texture. This is a very good beer.Dec 18, 2021"

L - Appearance is a deep dark brown, nearly black.

T - Not at all like it smells, and I can’t quite put my finger on the flavors. Mild carbonation, and I like it better as it warms. Not at all sweet, maybe even a bit bitter. Root beer? Char? Can’t quite tell, but unlike any barrel aged stout I’ve had.

look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 412oz can poured into a tulip. Pours almost black; creamy khaki head that fades leaving solid retention and lacing. The aromas are malt forward. Hints of chocolate and cocoa. Some cherries and dark fruits. Mild hints of vanilla. The bourbon is pretty subtle in the aroma department and almost goes unnoticed. The flavors are balanced. More chocolate leading the way. More hints of vanilla coming from the oak. More cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins too. Some molasses. Subtle spiciness. Possibly some hints of rye and black pepper in the mix. The bourbon is subtle but noticeable and blends well with everything. Subtle sweetness. Low bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Subtle alcohol flavors in the finish along with an enjoyable warmth, but it's not hot or boozy at all. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy, velvety, creamy and smooth. 



This is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. It's subtle and bold at the same time. I always liked Plead The 5th, but never tried the barrel-aged version so I'm glad to have finally tried it after all of these years. It's simply enjoyable and fun to drink. Not bad at all. I like it.Mar 02, 2021"

12 oz wax-tipped bottle, into a snifter. 



Crude-oil brew, viscous as hell. No apparent carbonation, no head. Nose is anise-forward, with notes of molasses and oak at the edge of the bouquet. Flavors are full of licorice and root beer. Molasses, tobacco, hints of coffee and leather. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected given the lack of carbonation. Medium finish (for the style), sweet with lingering residuals.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5From the 12 oz can (!?!) in a snifter. This solid imperial pours a rich

coal black with a very nice head of light brown foam that dissipates

to a thick ring, thin swirling pool, and shows some nice lacing. Nose of

bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark coffee, dark chocolate, balanced char and

roast, and loads of warming, astringent booze. Flavors exceed by a nice

presentation of brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, rich oak, warming booze, 

dark chocolate, faint tobacco, dark fruit notes of black and blueberry, 

and a nice dash of cream. Nice mouth feel; full body, rich, smooth, 

lightly creamy, coating, light carbonation, and a warming boozy finish

with a bitter malt end note. 



A wondrous symphony of malt and barrel in perfect harmony!

The nose is of dark roast coffee, roasted malt and a touch of mapley sweetness. I can’t wait to dive in.



The feel is thick and chewy, and the taste follows the nose; robust coffee notes with a touch of sweet maple. Fantastic stout with huge flavor. And loving that it’s only 7.7%. (The fact that I used the word “only” goes to show how out of control ABVs have gotten!)



One drawback as I get deeper into the glass is that the bitter burnt coffee notes that I found pleasant at the beginning turn into a laborious astringency that makes me take the taste points down a notch.Aug 05, 2022"

Brewers Notes: Daily Serving was born out of our desire to express intense, saturated fruit character in beer form. After thoughtful experimentation with Permutation 6.47 and 6.51, we found that a base recipe similar to the German Berliner Weisse style, with its delicate, yet fluffy mouthfeel and even-keeled acidity is the perfect foundation for robust fruit additions.



For Twice the Daily Serving, we've amplified the mouthfeel, fruit addition, and ABV to achieve our most expressive and luscious fruit beer to date. Brewed with an outlandish amount of raspberries, this beer pours a gorgeous deep ruby red color. Lively aromas of homemade jam, juicy raspberry, and mixed berry fruit leather delight the palate. It finishes full-bodied, slightly sweet, and remarkably drinkable.



MALT: American 2-row Barley, Flaked Wheat, White Wheat, Acidulated Malt

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours black with a finger of tan-khaki foam. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, and caramely malts with some mild coffee mixed into the nose. Dark chocolate and molasses mingle for a little sweetness and complexity. Flavor profile is heavy stout, with roasty, toasty, caramely, nutty, and bready malts. Coffee comes in just after the start and lingers to the end. Mild coffee notes. Dark chocolate and molasses add a little further sweetness. Some bourbon and alcohol heat on the backend. Mouth feel is thick and heavy with a surprisingly still texture. Overall, heavy stout with some great coffee notes and some boozy heat too. Good blend of each, allowing the base stout to shine through the mix.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.752019 vintage, 13.2% ABV, 56 IBU, purchased form the cooler at Firestone in September and refrigerated until now (about 5-6 weeks later) poured into 2 snifters from a 12 oz bottle. Off-black color, about 1/8 inch or less of head. virtually no lacing. Wonderful roasted grain and coffee smell, but not as intense as some others like this style. Taste follows the brewer's description quite well. Most excellent mouthfeel; very smooth and viscous. Overall one excellent beer marred only by the hefty pricetag of $10/12oz and I prefer a little more head retention and a little more coffee-forward smell, which I admit is totally subjective.Oct 25, 2020"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Who says that you can't have brunch at night, or that you can't have one on Tuesday? Kane Brewing's pick-me-up and put-me-down Imperial Porter means that you can have that Sunday brunch anytime you'd like.



Bourbon Barrel Aged Sunday Brunch is a bold and dark ale that pours with a scant froth and a near-black appearance to achieve the look of a dark roasted coffee. Its decadent and roasty scent immediately strikes the nose with maple, bourbon spice, cocoa and coffee. Its strong malty taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple, molasses, caramel, candied coconut and vanilla.



And that decadence continues across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to a robust. dark roast coffee, walnut, dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream, and ushers in a bittersweet taste with nuances of charred oak, coconut, peppery whisky and a woodsy bitterness to offset the lingering malts.



Full in body, the lavish porter is mild enough in texture to mimic the feel of a nougat, suggared espresso bean, except with a hot chocolate under current. Spiced with a bourbon inspired glaze, the oaken attitude of charred woods and peppery tannins play a sweet and spicy tune on the after palate.Jan 19, 2022"

Barrel aroma is faint. Tastes like the original Sunday Brunch, with an additional depth to it via barrel aging. Flavor is dominated by maple syrup; cinnamon follows quickly, and finishes with a touch of coffee. Cinnamon adds a gritty dimension to it, and becomes pervasive as it warms. The bourbon barrel treatment doesn’t offer a lot in this beer unfortunately. Just a little extra chocolate and mellowness. Carbonation is light, and it feels thin, has a bit of a tanginess to it. Overall, not an exceptional BA beer from Kane, I expected a little bit more from the barrel program than this.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Disclaimer: Not a professional beer-rater. Just enjoy a nice tasty beer.



-Enjoying this fine porter on release day (01/25/2020). Poured straight from the bottle into a tulip glass. 



-Shallow pour shows a nice brown color. Appears black and turbid in a full glass but the nice brown color remains on the edges. Head is a nice light brown, which died down pretty quickly. Not very much lacing. 



-Very sweet smelling maple and boozy bourbon. Those are the only scents I'm getting. Not smelling any coffee really.



-Tastes exactly as it smells. Strong maple and bourbon flavor but that's about it. Would be lying if I said I tasted coffee. Pure bourbon and maple flavor, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it feels pretty different from the original Sunday brunch. One thing worth noting though is that it doesn't taste as boozy as it smells. The alcohol is hidden very well. Would not have guessed it was 11%.



-Mouth feel is near-perfect. Not as thick as I would have expected but surely far from watery. Perfect amount of carbonation. 



-Overall, I think this beer is absolutely delicious and deserves its highly acclaimed status. That being said, I would definitely like if there was a bit more coffee flavor to it, as that is one of my favorite aspects of the original Sunday brunch. Is it worth the price? Debatable. But its damn good and I would definitely recommend it to any porter/stout lover. 5/5.Jan 25, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Poured from a bottle (b1) into a 2021 BBT glass



L: pours a very dark black brown, bare minimum head and no visible carbonation. Stains the glass somewhat, decent legs but less than I expected given style and abv



S: wow, that is a serious aroma. Big waves of raisin (more pronounced as it warms), dark chocolate truffles, and vanilla on a backbone of oak and barrel heat. Some caramel/toffee in the back as well



T: follows the nose well, chocolate notes lead nicely with raisin and vanilla not far behind. Chocolate covered raisins, some dark chocolate ganache, cream caramels. Get a nice coffee when nearly right out of the fridge, more than the nose suggested. Abv is there but never steals the show, makes itself known and nicely warming



F: low+ carb, heavy- body. Coats the mouth wonderfully, full without being overly viscous



O: a very big brew, no doubt about that. Wonderfully balanced aroma and flavor result in a nuanced beer that doesn’t pound you over the head with just one or two aspectsJul 25, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25A: Asphalt highlights to an obsidian pour that’s oily in circumference. The neck tops a bone white hue with a darkened downturn, of a penny toned rim. Thus, not much room for retention, which is limiting on lace entanglements. A collar that continues to lessen with a sensibility on heat, for slightly etching the windowpanes



S: A barrel awareness to stronghold the roasted grains with a bourbon presence. The start is a molasses coating on dark fruit skins, as an espresso roast loiters to the maple backs, of a sickly shrewd growth. Namely, a syrupy tumor upon the timed warmness, as malt creams the humid agilities. There are light recordings of Cherry Cordials at the midriffs, while maple further purifies a combating to an adjoining development in the bourbon spaces. Meanwhile, a balanced hop weight to avoid a suffocating middle, which provides a light peppery woodiness near rearward resin. Subsequently, a hindmost movement from soft to mild – vanilla oak – tannins that signify a leathery convoy, besides the smoked-dry turfs 



T: The exertion has a cask dynamism of arrogance, as malt initially struggles to materialize off of burnt coffee. Howbeit, liquored hardihood stretches upon charred Raisinets, while conveying angles to figs & plums. Some positioning on early adoptions to tire track licorice with woodsy tannin partitions, which aid to reinforce those black treacle gears. In succession, a measure for the warming openness to adapt a caramel spread, for Scottish tablets, amidst the maple reinforcements on artisan S'mores. There is a small stake to reference trees of a deciduous nature, while dabbing at coniferous pine needles. This element further stretches across birch & paperbark maple, given a sharp (resinous) bite to kick-off the epilogs. To that end, a prevalence for maple to gridlock bourbon atop ruggedly pruned rawhide, while citing a slow-burning chimney fire



M: Sharply cutting feel that’s savvy in foundation with a bitter earthiness, and one to quickly smoothen out to the minute. In doing so, the effort is careful to not middle a cloyingness, by maintaining a clean acuity to the riding sweetness. There is a range of warmth that’s distinctively strong, but not a concern to dictate a heated fiasco. In parallel, a touch of acerbic tannin throughout, which works to profit the additives attributes with a slight sting to the clean & dry cessations



O: A fairly accessible presentation with a barrel presence to check the (semi-stick) extracts. A tactic that’s proficient in coordinating the rich malt layers to the woodsy hop effects, while bourbon perimeters all of their showpiecesJun 28, 2022"

O: Highly rated beer here from Transient, from my home state. Just got through Kentuckely, which I thought was just okay. Surprised to see such high ratings for this beer. Kind of a competitor to CBS, but with extra maple syrup and vanilla added. Gets a little muddled because of that for me. Little boozy and hot as well. It's a decent beer, I just wouldn't say it's that well balanced.



Recommendation: One of the better Transient beers I've had, but maybe not world class just yet.Jun 07, 2022"

Oh man, I’m so happy to be here. I’ve been waiting so long for Tree House to re-brew straight up, OG Double Shot. This has been (and is still) the highest rated American Stout on BA for quite a while, I’ve had it marked as a want for nearly 3 years. So, let’s get into another world class Stout



Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of dark mocha head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing



Oh man, the coffee is so forward in the nose, but there’s still a decent anount of that TH Stout-sweetness still. I’m picking up on aromas of spent coffee beans, espresso, chocolate fudge, caramel, toasted nuts, brown sugar, and light raisin



In taste the sweetness is mostly up front, and it starts to dry off into a slightly more traditional Stout on the back end. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting coffee candy, milk chocolate, brown sugar, toast, vanilla, sweet bourbon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of spent coffee beans, fruity coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, brown bread, raisin, and caramel



A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice roast character



I gotta say, with this newly brewed version of this beer being at 8.2%, I didn’t really think it would be a true American Stout. And is it that? No, not really, but it still retains some old school characteristic, and it’s just damn good regardless. I’m happy to have made a trip up to Tree House mostly for this beerJul 31, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Sent to me by the one and only @ovaltine whose beer prowess is so amazing he can get fresh Tree House stouts in Indiana.

Poured deep dark, not exactly black but darn near. The head was as dark a brown as I have seen on a beer, the one knock was the head didn’t stay long.

The aroma, mostly I just get vague impressions of aromas as I foolishly didn’t wear a respirator when working with some nasty chemicals. Every once in a while I get more, and those are treats! This one gets me coffee and roasted malts and bourbon and vanilla. Mostly coffee, but wow it’s all in there.

The taste followed, coffee leads and filled the spectrum at first, only swallowing allowed the roasted malts and bourbon (bourbon soaked Madagascar vanilla beans, who knew?) and the vanilla sneaks in last. I enjoyed every sip and it was gone too soon.

The feel was excellent for the sipping nature of this beer, soft almost, counters the nearly bitter coffee presence.

OA, thoroughly enjoyed this beer and now I want to go to the brewery for a vacation. Sadly, my partner said no. If I wanted to stay married that is.Jul 10, 2022"

Double Shot

Tree House Brewing

Date: 18 June 2021

This is the last Tree House beer; I have in my Fridge. Every beer I have consumed thus far has been blown my expectations away. My first stout from Tree House; when I opened the can, a heavy coffee aroma emitted. I poured the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass. The pour created a creamy and foamy dark brown two-fingered head with excellent retention. The color charts around SRM 26, dark brown like used motor oil without the highlights. 



Coffee is strong and present with the initial nosing. Dark roasted malts, toffee, molasses, a hint of smoke, a touch of char, and tobacco. The smell is dominated by the fragrant coffee aromas. 



One of the strongest coffee-flavored beers next to Oliphant Brewing Coffee Ale. The molasses, caramel, and toffee tempering out the bitterness. This created velvety coffee flavors. The dark roasted malts give some char, bready, and earthiness to the beer. I detect 



The mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and bold. 



The body is heavy, has low carbonation, and has a robust finish. 



The coffee flavors in the beer are rich and flavorful. One of the best coffee beers I have consumed in a long time. A must-try for any coffee stout lover.Oct 09, 2021"

Look: Pours a hazy light yellow with a fluffy white head that dissipates after a while leaving lots of lacing. Some floaters visible.



Smell: Fresh tropical fruits, especially pineapple, mixed with some citrusy notes of orange and tangerine.



Taste: Quite contrary to the smell, citrus notes are dominating here with tropical pineapple and mango in the background. Medium sweetness with a slightly bitter, minimally zesty finish.



Feel: Fresh, juicy and quite full. Medium carbonation.



Overall: Full and fragrant pale ale that tastes somehow exactly as you‘d want a double dry hopped 6.8 ABV version of Pseudo Sue to taste. One of the best pale ales I‘ve had and quite rightly a top ten beer in this category.May 04, 2022"

Palate Contaminants: none



Wet straw color, completely opaque. Lots of very fine white head, with lots of lacing.



All sorts of citrus on the nose. Red grapefruit, acidic orange, touches of lime. Moderately sweet malt. Marshmallows. It strikes a really nice balance.



The fruits are dialed back in the taste, and there's more of a vegetation/leafy flavor up front. Mild bitterness. Tart sweetness shows up a bit late, right there with the citrus. The flavors are notably sharp, too. (And this particular can was brewed five weeks ago.)



Aftertaste is bitter, but it's a dull bitterness. Very nicely integrated carbonation, and it's one of the finest I've run across. Medium weight.Mar 16, 2022"

4.29/5  rDev -5.3%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5A: The beer is very hazy to cloudy pale yellow in color. It poured with a finger and a half high white head that has excellent retention properties and hardly died down.

S: Moderate aromas of lime citrus are present in the nose along with notes of lychee.

T: The taste follows the smell, except that the flavors of lime and lychee are more balanced. Only a slight amount of bitterness is perceptible.

M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and a bit juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.

O: This beer has the amount of aromas and flavors you would expect from an Imperial IPA but has the drinkability you would expect from an APA.

Intro: 12 oz. had on tap poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.



Appearance: Cloudy, hazy orange, Moderate head maybe 1.5 inch. good lacing as I drank



Smell: Sweet, tangy citrus smell with like orange and pineapple. Appealing, inviting. Made my mouth water in anticipation.



Taste: Follows the smell. Very nice.



Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. .Didn’t really make my mouth pucker as it didn’t taste like a hop bomb.



Drink: Easy drinker. well balanced and went down smooth.



Conclusion: Really enjoyed this one. I’m not overly crazy about IPAs but this was well balanced and not over the top in bitterness. I could drink a few of these. Definitely try it if you have the chance.Mar 02, 2022"

I really want this on-tap. Slight haze, white cap, smells like lemon zest and danks. Tastes follows the smell, and this drinks like a double IPA at only 6.8%, so much hop packed into a small package.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5For the 2021 version! Sweet and rich chocolate malty, hint of vanilla, and hint of bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with a dark chocolate bitter, floral vanilla, and balanced boozy bourbon finish. A slight hint of age/oxidation can be detected on the backend, but this has aged/settled in extremely well for being about a year old. The bigboi booziness that you would expect at 17+% is there, but it is smooth and enjoyable...it starts to peek out a bit more as it warms. And, the mouthfeel is darn near perfect.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5Fundamental Forces is an Imperial Vanilla Stout from Bottle Logic. The one I drank had an ABV 17.17%, so a little stronger. I guess the Fundamental Force I got was the Strong Nuclear Force, the one with Gluons and Mesons. It's recommended with brownies. I didn't have brownies but my wife suggested oreo cookies but I thought that I didn't need to double it up. This beer is like 8 oreo cookies and that's enough. Maybe a little sweet, but it's good, very good, slightly boozy (well ABV 17.17%) but with all the other flavors that is not an issue.



Look: black with a half inch fluffy mocca colored head



Aroma: chocolate, vanilla, bourbon



Flavor: What stands out is the vanilla, the bourbon, the roasted malts, the coffee and chocolate.



Body/Overall: Full bodied, dessert in a bottle.Feb 07, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Midnight black pour with a thin brown ring and webbing. Huge aromas of vanilla lead the nose, with fudgey chocolate, full bourbon with potent molasses mash, chocolate truffle, hints of marshmallow and light plum liqueur. Amazing in the potency and complexity while keeping vanilla a star. Taste is a relative disappointment, like FO without the impeccable that has the flavors meld together. Bourbon and vanilla are in one camp, and chocolate truffle in another during the sip. Still delicious, but want more integration. Much warmer than FO too, feel is not as smooth or lush, but instead chewy. Still a wonderful stout well worth your time, but much prefer fundamental observation. The wife liked itMay 31, 2021"

Look - Black, with a brown twinge



Smell - Very strong Chocolate, tobacco, and bourbon barrel. As it warmed up, the aroma really came through



Taste - WOW, this was better than expected. Chocolate Fudge, Anise, and a heavy barrel presence. At 18%, it hides the alcohol really well. It’s there, but I’ve had 10% beers that are more boozy. Awesome after dinner sipper



Feel - A little thin, but it’s from 2013. Actually not nearly as bad as expected.



Overall - This was a pleasant surprise. Being from 2013, this beer has held up VERY well. Really smooth, bourbon barrel chocolatey stout. Enjoyed this more than it’s base Black Tuesday. Those cocoa nibs must add something special!Feb 06, 2021"

F: medium, slight bourbon burn. 

Overall: not overly complex. The biggest feat is making this 20% beast without it being a burny booze bomb, which it does very very well. I’ve had 10% beers that felt more filling and/or boozy. 

This is about 4 years old and has the vanilla and cocoa so maybe that has helped even more.Dec 04, 2020"

T- Chocolate, vanilla, some toffee, bourbon, oak, figs, roasted malts, a slightly charred quality to the finish.



M- Smooth, full body, minimal heat for the ABV.



O- This is fantastic. I recently reviewed a fresh can of Black Tuesday, and I will say between the aging of this and the cocoa and vanilla additions it smooths out all the rougher edge of the Black Tuesday.Nov 27, 2020"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.252016 release - consumed on November 12, 2020. 

Pours a very dark brown. 1 finger off white head. For the ABV, the retention is good. The head dissipates to a ring around the edge of the glass. There's some decent carbonation rising in the glass that makes the ring swirl about. No lacing on the glass. 

The nose is a sweet toffee aroma from the barrels. I do get a chocolate and vanilla undertone. 

Taste - Like the nose tons of toffee. The chocolate is really muted. I don't know if it would be stronger fresh. The chocolate and vanilla are on the backside. 

Very boozy, which isn't surprising. Even aged 4 years, very ""hot"". It isn't as thick as I was expecting. 

This is an interesting beer. good, but you know it's very strong, and must be slowly enjoyed.Nov 12, 2020"

Pours an opaque pale orangish yellow with about three fingers of white head. Amazing retention and lacing.



Crack of the can is big pineapples, oranges, some grass and a hint of melon and peaches.



Getting citrus peel in the taste-very nice bitterness-along with some of the aforementioned fruits. Well balanced taste.



Soft, full-bodied mouthfeel. Nice bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.



Wonderful beer to experience. Green or Gggreennn? Tough call to make...Jun 14, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25One month old. Can to wine glass.



Look: Pours a hazy, slightly muddy yellow with a stable foamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing. A few floaters visible.



Smell: Fresh citrus fruits and pineapple. Green and a bit dank.



Taste: Green hops and fresh fruits. Citrusy (lemon and orange) and tropical (pineapple and guava). Some hints of sweetness and a zesty, very bitter finish.



Feel: Juicy and quite crushable. Medium carbonation and some sharp notes.



Overall: As much as I prefer Very Green over Green, I prefer Very Gggreennn over Gggreennn. Sounds confusing, but this one tastes just a bit too green for me. It's still a very nice brew with the typical Tree House characteristics.Apr 05, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75I wish I had both Very Green and this and could go back and forth to compare. Very Green is probably my most favorite beer I’ve ever had. The flavors, the aroma, all of it. This is every bit what Very Green was from what I remember. I can’t say if it’s more flavorful or not, I just don’t have the reference point. All that being said, hot damn I love this beer. So dynamic. Juice slams you in face on the initial sip and then it fades to a piney after taste. You really kinda hit both NEIPA and West Coast styles all in one sip. Their is a slight difference when drank from the can and a glass. The can lip seems to fizz up the beer and almost hides some of that juice at the start. From the glass it’s so pronounced and smooth. The “green” beers are heaven, and the TreeHouse concept of “maxing them out” is a wonderful idea. It’s like heavy legs day at the gym. How much can I really do? Can not wait for another excuse to be in Western, Mass.Mar 05, 2022"

Big pineapple and Orange Julius in the nose. A hint of savory Italian herbs below.



Some of the pineapple carries over to the taste, but there’s a lot more lime, white pepper and pithy bitterness here. A little orange juice peaks out under the pith every once in a while in the aftertaste.



Full bodied and slick with strong carbonation.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4Pours an opaque OJ yellow, frothy 1.5"" white head with moderate retention and good lacing. Nose is mostly tropical - papaya and passionfruit juice, along with spent grain. A hint of spicy alcohol as well as it warms. Initially, the taste answers the question of what adding more Sunny D to a glass of Sunny D would taste like. The answer is Sunny D. It's OJ without the tartness, sweet yet somehow watered down at the same time. Flat, one-note sweetness. On the finish, however, it does develop some - hints of hop spice, a little resin here, a little pine there. White and black pepper. Mouthfeel, however, is pleasantly soft and full. Was hoping for more resinous punch here given the reviews, but any ""greenness"" takes a backseat.Feb 16, 2022"

Magnificent looking hazy, IMHO. The nose is rife with dank ripe oranges and mango, with some pineapple and melon as well.



The taste is focused on the ripe orange and mango flavors, with some melon and pineapple for kicks. There is zero discernible alcohol, quite impressive for an 8.8% ABV beer.



The mouthfeel features that trademark full, pillowy Tree House mouthfeel that keeps reeling you in for another sip. If you enjoy hazies (and I do), Tree House is your Holy Grail. World class stuff, IMHO.Sep 18, 2022"

A - Dark orange gold color with dense, soapy white lacing.



S - Very dank, juicy orange and mango totally dominate the nose (along with some pineapple). In fact, I could smell this beer from two feet away when I poured it!



T - Follows the nose, and nothing but juicy dankness from start to finish. Juicy and pithy orange, mango, fruit rind, pineapple, and passionfruit from start to finish. Finishes on the sweeter side with some underlying citrus bitterness.



M - Thick, pillowy soft, and chewy.



O - Maybe not a perfect 100 but it's high on the impressive list. Go get 'ya some.Sep 17, 2022"

Yeah, this was one of those beers.



One of my friends went up there recently and brought down a bunch of their recent releases. All were solid, as was this, was it was a worthy iteration of the Julius family. Poured like orange juice, felt like orange, juice, and had possibly the best head and lacing that I've ever seen in a Tree House beer as it perfectly settled and left behind thick rings that nearly resembled a sheet. Quite a sight to behold as the sensory enjoyment easily bled over into the nose and taste. Loads of dewy forest, dank hops, apricot, stone fruit, turbid orange, and slick juice were found in both as the smell and flavor profile of this brew were one and the same. So smooth, so fun, and so easy to fall in love with, this had a nice body, hints of wheat in the taste, and went down *way* too easily with a bit bit of dankness and floral notes staying around in the aftertaste.



I have no idea how this was 8.8% ABV as this felt like fermented juice with some hops and a bit of tropical fruit and swamp water thrown in for fun. Dated 8/24 on the bottom of the can with ""IT IS YOUR DESTINY"" written above it, the Star Wars reference was fun, just like the rest of this outstanding brew. Use the force, or whatever it takes, to get your hands on this and thank Tree House for still killing it after all of these years!Sep 08, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5L -- Jet black in the glass with a surprisingly robust two finger head produced with aerated pour. Hard to believe this has been bottle conditioning for a year and a half

S -- Waves of rich milk chocolate, wet bourbon barrel, prune, fig, chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, maple, and light smoke. Smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stout

T -- Incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. The bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. Very rich, mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. The bourbon is just a hair on the hot side

F -- Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Lasting, sweet finish. Oily and slick, less velvety than expected

O -- One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Patience is the name of game when it comes to barrel aging, and Hill Farmstead has it in spades. Very pricey @$25/17 oz, but it's worth it

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Finally trying this one, march 28 2021, bottled 10-3-18. For me the feel is just outstanding, full and creamy and smooth, approaching syrupy, but still with enough carbonation to keep it drinkable. It’s Hill Farmstead, of course the feel is going to be exceptional. The aroma is strangely mild but the flavor explodes with maple syrup and whiskey notes and has to be the sweetest of any HF beer I can recall. Just lean enough to stay in balance. Very nice drinking.Mar 28, 2021"

Appearance: 5 - blacky black but a bit thin at the edges. The head remains as a thin halo.



Nose: 4 - not very intense, but what is there is divine. Pure maple and barrel.



Taste: 4 - nothing mind-blowing here, just a straight up barrel aged maple stout. Maple is tough to do well, and this is done well.



Mouth: 5 - this is where the beer really shines. It's thick and sticky, and I don't want to swallow it; I just want to chew it for a while.



Overall: 4 - very excited to have tried this one. Not obsessed but satisfied.

Nose: Beautiful. Roasted malts and dark fruit jump out immediately. The bourbon is definitely there, adding nice vanilla and caramel notes. Chocolate notes come through nicely. The nose is generally sweet, with no detectable bitterness. Molasses starts to get noticeable as it warms.



Taste: Wow. What a nice marriage of roasted malts and sweet bourbon notes. Dark chocolate, charred oak, toffee, vanilla, dark berries, raisins, dates, a touch of leather, earth, and brown sugar. This is just a fantastic barrel-aged stout. Each sip makes me want more.

Pours an inky black body topped with over two fingers of fluffy, khaki-colored foam; decent head retention leaves paper-thin islands of cap, large, frothy collar, minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.



Aroma brings a soft touch of molasses upfront, carrying soft caramel creams into a steadily building oaky vanilla and eventually culminating with robust waves of raw cacao meeting oaky bourbon.



Taste opens with bittersweet cocoa tinged with toasted oak barrel and residual bourbon characteristics, though the malt is central, peaking over the mid-palate with the purest, flaky roast sensations cooly revealing layer upon layer of oily, raw cacao, burnt almond, and evocative dark chocolate.



Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body, silkily textured and, in tune with a soft, prickly carbonation, sporting mild gritty accents into the mid-palate; suggestions of distant char and balanced booziness enhance over the back end, eventually leveling out to a dry roast along the palate's finish.



Chocolate, malted chocolate, dragged from the most evocative expanses of its malt profile and kissed with a softly integrated bourbon implicating a doting heat to further accentuate the already resonant roast; a classic sipper, its quintessence on full display.Sep 20, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 4This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.



This smells like roasted malt, spicy oak, dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, and vanilla.



This is definitely old school in execution - there's lots of roast and spice here. There's a big barrel character - oak char, vanilla, spicy bourbon - it feels like something that was in barrels a decently long time. There's some dark fruit and lots of dark chocolate, along with a cigar-like bitterness.



This is medium bodied, not quite as thin as most Central Waters, with a *slightly* prickly carbonation to it. If the carbonation was dropped a smidgen, the mouthfeel would be much better.



There's a lot to love about this one - it's a good idea to revisit what barrel aged stouts used to be.Apr 30, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Striking gold isn't easy. Once you find it once, you gotta keep going back time after time. And that's what Central Waters Brewing does with their bourbon barrel aged American Double Stout. Except, its black gold.



And the beer of that exact namesake pours with the consistency of used motor oil, black and inky upon the pour, a patient froth begins to release. The draw of caramelized char, coffee, chocolate, nuttiness and wonderfully burnt cream is too much for the nose to resist. In similar form the initial taste is lush with molasses, brown sugar and cream in suggestive of roasted marshmallows.



As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a strong sense of coffee, cocoa and roasted walnut overcomes the sweetness and begins to usher in the bourbon complexities with charred oak, vanilla, coconut, cherry and caramelized whisky spice. Trending moderately bitter, the late palate highlights a walnut character with coffee-like bitterness although all are probably hop-derived.



Full bodied and quite decadent overall, the rich and chewy ale never promotes cloying textures, but finishes long and fat with malt flavor and mouthfeel. An extended warmth of peppery whisky and a simmering bourbon heat resonates slightly past the char and the beer's nearly port-like fruitiness.Dec 28, 2020"

4.4/5  rDev -3.1%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent.May 06, 2022"

4.46/5  rDev -1.8%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind

Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft

Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat

Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat

Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows. Tons of hops, tons of malt sweetness, boozy, and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. A well done and tasty IIIPA. Recommended.Jan 31, 2022"

32oz growler served in a SIP Fest 2020 snulip. Bought it yesterday at Thirsty Hop. I've had this several times before, but the first time in a situation where I could sit down and pay attention and write my thoughts.



Pours a clear light amber with a small head. Looks thick. Lots of fine slow carbonation. Smell is booze, pine, lemon. Might get a little honeysuckle.



Taste is a boozy blast, lemon and citrus for sure, so much resin and pine, kind of dancing around -- first I taste this, then that then it switches again. Hard bitter finish. Something kind of tropical in there, too.



Mouthfeel is medium and surprisingly dry. Overall...this is really good. Dangerously easy to drink. I knew it was really good. It's nice to pay attention to it. I consider this a prime example of west coast style TIPA.Oct 02, 2020"

Taste is surprisingly similar, while coconut laden nose is fun, want more barrel for the taste. Malt work stabilizes the complexion though, with velvet smooth coffee setting in near the finish. The feel is very smooth, but it is light in both body and barrel, coconut defines somehow even more than LS. Like last snow better, but still a nice porter.

look: 1.25 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 1.25 | feel: 1.5 | overall: 1.25A tremendous let down. The barrel aged version of Last Snow, and just as big of a let down.



Look: Pours what looks to be light-medium bodied. That’s immediate disappointment. You’re a barrel aged porter, you should look robust and either full bodied, or the high end of medium bodied. 



Nose: What’d you expect: Coconut and Barrel mostly.



Taste: Barrel Aged Coconut Water



Feel: Far too light in my mouth for what I’m looking for.



Overall: Like the other porters I’ve recently tried from Funky Buddha, I had high hopes, only to be let down. Beer Advocate has about 150 beers with a 100 rating, and this is one of them. It is not deserved. This is total swill.Jul 09, 2020"

4.19/5  rDev -7.7%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25Drank 03.24.20 out of a tulip, bottle dated 2016 or 2017, properly cellared. 



Hate to say I was slightly underwhelmed. A nice looking beer with a nice feel, not at think as I've come to expect from FB, but still good. Did get a nice coconut smell and taste but think the time on the bottle probably muted both of those a bit. The thing I didn't like as much was the roasty taste, which I guess might be the porter part, but could also be some darker coffee roasts. And no hint of alcohol or barrel at all - this would have help for me. So be it, my opinion. I'd like to try a fresher bottle, but given the cost, probably only if I'm gifted it some day...fat chance at that! Cheers!Mar 25, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.2516oz. Can served in a tulip. Pours a dull orange with a loose, quarter inch, off-white head embedded with pinpricks and a hazy clarity. Nose is (wait for it) … juicy. Notes of navel orange, tropical fruit and pith. Taste follows nose with a light herbal/medicinal bitterness that lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive carbonation and a slight oiliness to the texture. Overall, decent but no different than most of their hazy IPAs.Sep 08, 2022"

L: Pours an opaque dark gold with a thick fluffy head with big bubbles. Wild looking lacing.



S: Aromas of mango and orange creamsicle, although fairly faint.



T: Mango up front, then orange and tangerine. Finishes with grapefruit and a slightly dry bitterness. The flavors are encased by a supercharged hop character that creates a mild astringency.



F: Soft mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.



O: Enjoyable flavor profile but docked a notch for the hop burn.Aug 28, 2022"

4.28/5  rDev -6.3%
look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5From a 16oz can, dated 08/11/22. Space juice. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.



Pours a thoroughly opaque, murky mango colour with a finger or so of super-soft, sudsy head. Retention is quite good, leaving a sudsy cap and a tattered blanket of foamy lacing.



Nose is unexpectedly quite feeble. Subtle aroma of that signature TH peachy-bubblegum-yeasty thing but too faint to say much more than that.



Taste follows the nose inasmuch as it isn’t as intense as I expected - which isn’t entirely a bad thing. Tasting fleshy peach, tangerine peel and a shit-ton of macerated bitter green tree leaves. The usual, expected supporting notes of mango, grapefruit juice, papaya and sticky pineapple.



Feel is… this can is, what, nearly two weeks old and the hop-onslaught is still so intense that it no-shit made my throat constrict! I actually took a moment to wonder which of my neighbours was most likely to have an epi-pen. Aside from that, it’s soft and juicy, medium bodied and brightly carbonated. Dry, sticky lips.



Overall, aside from the epic hop-burn, it’s not as crazy as I might have expected - which, again, aside from the price, isn’t entirely a bad thing. Hey! what do you know, this is the 103rd Tree House beer I’ve reviewed. Point being: this one is virtually indistinguishable from probably 90% of the other TH NEIPA’s I’ve had. I could actually see myself drinking this on the regular, if my throat didn’t clench up and choke me to death.Aug 24, 2022"

Received from @beersnake1 in Bif15 , poured into a smog city brewing glass also from him. The #4 ranked barley wine on beer advocate is a double barrel aged barley wine 





Brewers Notes: A blend of two different Double Barrel-Aged Barleywines. The first Barleywine was aged in a Woodford Reserve Malt Whiskey barrel for over 20 months, then finished in a combination of Weller and Blanton Bourbon casks for close to a year. The second Barleywine was first aged in an Armagnac puncheon for close to two year, then finished in a blend of Heaven Hill Rye and Sazerac Rye casks. Each beer was cold-conditioned in stainless, and then blended together to create this Double Barrel-Aged Barleywine.





Dark , murky, muddy brown liquid capped by a thin taupe foam layer , quickly recedes to a taupe ring 



Aroma is bourbon, raisins, toffee



Taste is bourbon soaked raisins, toffee, dark fruits , 



Mouthfeel is soft and fizzy , sweet , the 15.7 % abv is very well hidden



Great beer , another want ticked off my list courtesy of @beersnake1, thank youApr 29, 2022"

4.51/5  rDev -2.2%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75A: Pour an almost opaque yet still clear dark mahogany in color with light to moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate chestnut brown + cola brown + garnet red + ruby red colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a small to medium sized patch of wispy very thin film covering approximately 25% of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edge of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.



S: Moderate to strong aromas of Armagnac/Brandy + Bourbon + Rye over the top of slightly stronger than moderate aromas of toasted + bready + caramel + toffee malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amounts of dark fruit (raisin + plum + cherry) + caramel + toffee sweetness. Light to moderate aromas of toasted oak + vanilla.



T: Upfront there are slightly stronger than moderate flavors of toasted + bready + caramel + toffee malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amounts of dark fruit (raisin + plum + cherry) + caramel + toffee sweetness. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of toasted oak + vanilla. Finally there are moderate to strong flavors of Armagnac/Brandy + Bourbon + spicy Rye. No perceptible hop flavor is present and the booziness along with spiciness from the rye linger well through the finish.



M: Full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with slightly heavier than moderate amounts of alcohol warming in the finish.



O: Drinks quite easily considering how big/strong ABV and intense this beer is and the alcohol is well hidden other than the warming feeling. Very enjoyable with lots of complexity to the flavors and aromas with tons of contribution from the different barrel treatments.Apr 10, 2022"

Pours medium brown with a thin white head that fades. Aroma is amazing, so complex with the aforementioned notes. Taste is also complex and somewhat overpowering, but in a good way. Feel is also excellent, creamy and clean. Overall, wow.Apr 03, 2022"

Taste is unbelievably complex, with layers of roasted grain, whiskey and top notch cognac. Not overly sweet, medium dry, very clean finish, not a fault anywhere.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4Appearance: Pours a murky burnt caramel color that is clear enough if you look at it carefully; the one finger beige head fades to a ringlet and archipelago while leaving a few spots behind



Smell: The Armagnac puncheon and Rye casks really show their influence on the aroma though there is Bourbon in the fold, as well; the expected Barleywine tones of caramel, raisin, spice cake and vanilla; there is a strong sweet cherry component, too



Taste: The brandied flavors of Armagnac hit the taste buds at the outset, with the cherry, raisin, caramel and spice cake flavors emerging; spicy Rye, vanilla and Bourbon tones emerge, in the middle, with the finish being sweet and boozy



Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low carbonation; considerable warmth in the gullet



Overall: A lot going on here, perhaps too much, as I don't think the Armagnac, Rye and Bourbon coalesce very well and I would prefer a bit more of a hop presence to balance out the sweet cherry tones - definitely extreme, thoughMar 10, 2022"

EBB night 3, beer 4! The finale! It's quite funny to me how I planned for me and my buddy to drink these box beers together over 3 nights and made sure this one was the finale, pretty much right as al the beers were officially announced. I just wanted something huge to finish off with. Now, I'm drinking what climbed up to the 4th highest rated American Barleywine, and the 93rd highest rated beer overall on BA. That's absolutely wild for a fest-exclusive beer, and I couldn't be more excited to finally try this one. Let's get into it



Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing



This is very boozy in the nose, quite sweet for an American expression if the style. I’m picking up on aromas of brown sugar, hot bourbon, raisin, sweet caramel, dark bread, and light vanilla



As I’m sipping this, I think it’s good, but not really as good as everyone else is making it out to be. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dates, molasses, brown sugar, earthy bourbon, vanilla, dark bread, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, earthy toffee, spicy whiskey, vanilla, light rye, raisin, and brown sugar



A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry from the booze



Yeah so this was good, but I don’t think it was anything near what it was hyped up to be. I don’t think it was masterfully blended or anything but I enjoyed itMar 06, 2022"

Follows the nose very nicely. Rich toffee, chocolate, bourbon, Armagnac, figs, maple syrup, blackberries, red grapes, port, and a very slight roasted malts note. There is a very faint hint of pipe tobacco, but it's literally 1% of the taste. The best way to describe this is rich and robust. Sweet, but not cloying. The barrel influence is crazy.

It’s very pretty for a beer. The perfect Instagram shot can be has for anyone with this given it’s bright colors. There’s a little lacing that stays around. I don’t get as much on the nose as I’d like from the absolute favorite IPAs I’ve had. It smells grapefruit zesty and you get that on the tongue. The beer shines through in its bitter balance with sweetness. Alcohol is very well hidden. Why do they make these in only 12oz cans!!

Welp, I inadvertently ended up here for Zwanze Day! I was at a show right down the road at Palladium and figured I’d come here after, only to find some true whales of mine. It’s finally time to see what their grape Lambic



Pours a clear reddish purple with a finger of light pink head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing



It’s quite soft in the nose, but there’s still the requisite funk. I’m picking up on aromas of red wine vinegar, lemon juice, wheat bread, wet hay, stone, and sharp oak



There’s more bite to it in taste, but conversely less grape. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting wildflower honey, lemon juice, straw, apple skin, red grape, light toasted oak, and a hint of cherry. The swallow brings notes of lemon zest, wet hay, sharp oak, red wine vinegar, crabapple, light blueberry, and pear skin



A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and tart



Damn, this is awesome stuff. Not quite on par with Fou Foune, but it’s always nice to try CantillonSep 25, 2022"

4.47/5  rDev -1.5%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.52019 Vintage - poured into a wine stem at 45°F. 



Pours a bright, translucent ruby stone red, with half a finger of pinkish-white head forming, and then immediately settling to a thin collar. Simple, but very pretty.



Nose: Soft grainy base, with raw wheat and dusty grain silo, beneath a very bright, vibrant fruit layer. This isn't deep, saturated, sweet grape, but young, fresh, and juicy. Some underlying jammy notes of red currant, blackberry, raspberry, peak through, with a deeper red wine note coming in and out of focus. Some gooseberry, pear, and lemon notes lend brightness and fruity acidity atop a very restrained, young funk presence, with hay, stable, leather, wet oak, petrichor, grass, and topsoil. 



Palate: Saint Lamvinus greets the palate with a mildly tart spark, paired perfectly with a thread of sweetness. I believe both the grain *and* the fruit are lending some sugars here. Bright, yet musty grape, with a touch of red berries, abd then the brighter notes emerge, showcasing lemon, gooseberry, white grape, and unripe stone fruit. With this, the tartness increasing, becoming fully dry, with high minerality opening the door for classic Cantillon funk - sea shells, salty air, old wet oak, hay, damp soil, and an almost brie/bloomy rind neutral musty note. Some significant oak tannins emerge, alongside a subtle, tonic-like bitterness. Tartness disappears, finishing with red wine cask, grape skin, and grapefruit pith. 



Mouthfeel/Body: This seems to have found its sweet spot, with 7% ABV balancing between enough grain to lend presence, but not enough to advance from the background. Delicate and fluid, but enough body to lend a softness. Effervescence is extremely fine and gentle, but still fairly fizzy. Not puckering - tartness is kept in check, and allows for a progression of dryness. Balanced tannins. 



Overall: A delicate, expressive, and definitively Cantillon Cantillon. The grape presence appears simple at first, but unfurls with some subtle but complex depth, pairing with just the right amount of complimentary funk. The subtle suggestion of sweetness is beautiful, and the lambic proceeds with these little ""chapters"" of flavour. Remarkably balanced and approachable, with an elegant simplicity.Dec 25, 2020"

16 fl. oz. can coded ""YOU CAN CALL ME AL 04/27/22 06:57:53"". Sampled on 05/17/22

$15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22



Notes via stream of consciousness: The label states that this is the ""twin brother to Julius"", and that it ""builds upon Julius with... Mosaic and Amarillo..."". A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far. The aroma offers upsome sweetish malt, soft berries, and orange. The flavor is fuller with additional notes of mango, passionfruit, peach, lychee, floral blossoms, grass, pine, and earth. A median bitterness balances it and along with a little bit of ""hop bite"" leads to a dry finish with some fruit, pine, earth, and spice lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. The head held up quite well and there are torn sheest of lace and craggy rings left throughout the glass. I actually like this better than Julius but that's probably just because Mosaic hops are my current favorite.

So this was literally canned fucking today. That’s wild to me, as fresh as Tree House can be. This is one I’ve somehow missed every time I take a trip out to the brewery, but I’m happy to finally get to it. Yet another TH beer in the top 250 as well. Let’s get into it



Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing



The nose shows a surprising amount of balance, but it makes sense considering it’s based on Julius. I’m picking up on aromas of juicy mango, peppery hops, apricot, doughy malt, orange juice, and papaya



It is similarly balanced in taste, feeling bright and juicy. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tangerine zest, crackery malt, juicy mango, earthy hops, orange juice, and peach. The swallow brings notes of peppery hops, tangerine zest, crackery malt, papaya, gooseberry, and light orange zest



A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness



Yet another killer NEIPA from Tree House. Better than Julius, but not quite as good as King Julius still. Maybe it’ll be even better when it’s not so freshApr 28, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5No age on this one, filled in a growler on 3/12/20. I believe it's 3-4 weeks since brewing.



Pours a nearly completely opaque golden yellow straw with a finger of creamy head that dissipated rather quickly. Big nose of mango, dried peach, candied ruby grapefruit, cara cara orange, slight bubblegum, pineapple, over-ripened apricot and Portuguese sweet bread. Just bursting with a sweet candied tropical fruit aroma, love it. Tons of flavor on first sip, all the notes of the nose melded together well with an addition of over-ripe papaya, slight dankness, honeydew melon and a little bit of pine resin. I'm so glad I got a 64oz growler of this one! So good! Wonderful soft, slightly resin-y medium body but I kinda wish it had just a tiny bit more fullness. Medium- bitterness, medium drying, medium- prickly carbonation.. Today was my first time on jury duty and I'm glad I stopped by Trillium for this one, I can't think of a better brew to relax with after a long day.Mar 13, 2020"

The smell is incredible here, an overload of papaya, banana, pineapple, orange and mango, just the lightest hop bite to back it up



The taste is a bit of a letdown compared to the aroma but still awesome. I get piney, resinous hops, a light florality, very tropical



The feel is nice and prickly, pretty highly carbonated and drinks medium bodied

Super thick hazy appearing. Dark yellow. 

Creamy head. Minimal lacing. 

Standard tropical hop aromas. 

Standard tropical hop tastes. Some citrus and wine notes in there. Some dankness for good measure. 

Good mouthfeel, but there’s a significant hop burn going down. I think they went too far with the dry-hopping. Instead of bitter taste they accentuated the throat burning effect. 

To me an average to below-average hazy, in a giant sea of average hazies. 

I’m shocked that it was rated this well actually. I can only attribute it to hazy hype and/or rewarding for pushing the limits.Feb 20, 2020"

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5Received this beauty from Dimidiata in an LIF connected to NBS BIF #14 - and she wasn't even part of that BIF!

Poured into a stout snifter the color of black coffee while being poured, looked onyx black with enticing looking light brown foam *trying* to form a head but failing, leaving a ring of foam around the edge.

The aroma is amazing, and my sense of smell is poor. Bourbon soaked oak, figs or prunes, molasses, leather all roll up into one delectable aroma, though from the description, I wouldn't have thought so. (Leather? Huh)

The taste is somehow sublime and over the top. Sublime in layers, the fig and/or prune flavor rises and falls through the chocolate and coffee and char that swirl in, all of which are supplanted by a powerful bourbon laced malty wonderful that is the body of this beer. At 19.5% ABV I was expecting heat from the raw alcohol, but that aspect is all but gone.

The feel is definately viscous, and rightfully so. Almost overly so. Just a bit. But that's a tiny quibble.

OA, Wow, really tasty.Dec 22, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 09/13/21, 18.9% ABV. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little bit. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is strong, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, molasses, figs, dark chocolate, cream, roasted malt and some licorice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, oak, booze, earthy, dark bread and coffee flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Has a boozy kick but it's still pretty drinkable for being that strong. Some more age wouldn't hurt this brew at all. I thought this was a pretty good imperial stout, definitely worth trying if you're into big barrel aged imperial stouts!Dec 21, 2021"

Brewers Notes: Our infamous Black Tuesday is an imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels for over a year. Rich caramel, toasted malt, vanilla, burnt wood and anise are just a few of the many flavors in this rich, decadent imperial stout.

Chilled bottle rested in my beer fridge for a special event. Thanksgiving table is set , let’s get after it



Poured into a Spiegelau stout glass , one finger brown foam cap , quickly recedes to a ring over a dark cola red brown liquid 



Aroma is bourbon, tobacco, leather , char, roasted malts 



Taste is bourbon, char, oak, roasted malts , licorice

Nose has huge notes of leather, molasses, and tobacco; bourbon and barrel notes come secondary as it warms, along with a bit of dark fruit. Taste is super complex, but definitely reflects the aroma - lots of leather, hearty, salty, iron-rich blackstrap molasses, Australian licorice; as it warms, more heat from the barrel, vanilla, char. Mouthfeel is very full, but with a small punch of small carbonation. Despite the warming heat, it hides its alcohol very well. Overall, definitely worth its reputation.Nov 21, 2021"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father. This is the beer of a faithful husband. This is the beer of a youthful grandpa. This is getting my top ratings. What a way to celebrate Father's Day 2021!Jun 21, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.



Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.



As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.



Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino.Nov 09, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Appearance - The poured a murky black color with a dark tan head. 



Smell - The nose was rich sweet chocolate. It may have been a chocolate maple combination. 



Taste - Chocolate really stood out in the initial taste. It brought to mind chocolate cola. There were also notes of coffee, maple, and a touch of cinnamon. I knew this was not Mexican Cake, but I expected more heat from the chilies. The rest of the profile was well balanced. 



Mouthfeel - The feel was slick with sweetness and modest carbonation. 



Overall - I thought the beer was tasty, but I expected a bit more. Mainly, it lacked spice.Aug 08, 2020"

500ml bottle served in a footed pilsner glass. 2021 vintage. Received from the glorious @jonphisher.



Pours very dark brown with a small head that fades slowly to an almost invisible skin and a small ring around the glass. Smell is chocolate and cinnamon.



Taste is cinnamon first, and all else second. Milk chocolate is definitely there. Some coffee bitterness. Might be a hint of syrupy sweetness.



Mouthfeel is medium tending toward thick. Overall, this is a good beer, but too much cinnamon for me. But, I'm a little oversensitive to cinnamon in beer.Feb 07, 2022"

- Imperial Milk Stout brewed with Rook Coffee, maple, and cinnamon. 



A: Beautiful cascading effect with a dark tan head that is creamy and dense, standing a true two inches. The exiting pour was coffee colored, thick and viscose as it slurps from the bottle. Strong lasting coverage. Lots of micro-bubbly activity. 



S: Burnt molasses, and chocolate. Dark sweet fruit, plums, sugary figs outlines. Sweet caramel and milky vanilla highlights. The maple syrup is rich and sweet, as well with evident hints of cinnamon spicing. Sweet initially, rich chocolate and marshmallow with cocoa. Things progressively move towards a smooth roastiness of cold coffee, caramel, and milky vanilla highlights. 



T: Sweet dark fruit, particularly figs and plums with a smooth campfire minerality for flavor. The maple syrup plays a strong and sweet role in the profile. Silty coffee and caramel, with some molasses are strong supporters. Silty coffee texture and covering with sweet caramel and roastiness teasing the tongue and inner cheeks. Sweet roasty sweetness of chocolate and coffee with vanilla and maple syrup highlights really define the flavor profile. 



M: Silty smooth texture on the mouthful with a equally smooth silty mouthful contribute and are equally as impressive. 



O: The syrup backing brings sweetness and depth, while the cinnamon spicing has a nice finishing and complimentary touch. Outstanding flavor and texture. Everything blends so beautifully together its almost unreal. Sweet milky-vanilla with maple syrup and a silty texture leads to an outstanding drinkability that is exceptionally smooth and extraordinary.Mar 13, 2021"

4.59/5  rDev +0.9%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Appearance - The beer poured an oily black color with a tan colored head and lacing left behind.



Smell - to put it simply, it smells like cinnamon toast. They were definite bread notes. 



Taste - This tasted like cinnamon toast. They were definite bready notes with spice with just a touch of maple sweetness. The cinnamon was nicely balanced and not oppressive. In the back, it leaned more towards bitter coffee as the sweetness faded.



Mouthfeel - Being a porter, it was a little less clingy than a stout with less tendency to coat the mouth. It was still able to linger for a while b



Overall - This was great. It was not as heavy as a dessert stout.Jan 10, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 | overall: 53 June 2021 - Beer #239 - BA Top 250 Alert!



Acquired via trade



Appearance: 4 - looks a bit pale, but the head stuck around beautifully. I was expecting a deeper orange.



Nose: 5 - holy peaches! I don't detect much of anything else. Doesn't even smell sour.



Taste: 5 - oo, this is more complex than I expected. Tons of peach, but otherwise very dry. You really get the barrel a lot. See kids, this is the difference between a slushy kettle sour and a proper barrel aged sour.



Mouth: 4 - just a drop flat. Thick for a sour, but I could use a few more bubbles.



Overall: 5 - an outstanding saison. World class.

L - Pours a hazy golden with a one finger white head. Nice lacing.

S - Tropical combination of grapefruit and orange. However, nothing really overpowering., which is good.

T - follows the nose a bit. Juicy hops. Kind of a hop “pow” at the end but no lingering aftertaste.

F - medium mouth feel and fairly smooth. Some carbonation.

O - A really good beer. I’m glad I had it.Mar 27, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25Canned 11/08/21. Let sit out for 15 minutes , before opening.



Lightly hazy orangey-gold, with about 1.5 fingers of pale orangey-tan head. Leaves behind about 1.25"" of 1/3 coverage streaky & spotty lacing, and a thin surface sheet, with a small mound of foam in the center. 



Smell is light candied orange rind, a vague mix of fresh citrus, a bit of light pine, and some fresh-biscuit malt aroma . 



Taste is a sweet orange rind flavor, but that of freshly-peeled orange rind that's been sweetened, rather that the usual dried /cooked[i.e., like marmalade] flavor. As such, it's also a bit sweeter than the usual too. Near finish, there's some faint pine, plus a touch of cooked sweet onion flavor (rather than the usual raw green onion). Very slight bitterness adds some balance towards finish, and lingers beyond. Brief, slight bread crust appears just as the liquid disappears. 



Feel is heavy-side-of-medium, which actually seems lighter I would expect, given the aroma,taste, and abv. Slight drying effect after finish. A light internal warming feeling shows up after two or three sips, but no alcohol heat on the palate, or at the back of the throat.



Overall, pretty good. Better than all but one TIPA that I've had* . A little sweeter than I prefer, but not TOO much. Dangerously easy-drinking. That said, other than as an abv delivery device, (if you want that) I still don't see anything to recommend it over the DIPA, or normal version. All-in-all, a pleasant experience, though I prefer normal Sip just a tad more. :)

Very full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel due to the moderate carbonation. The high ABV adds a warmness on the finish. This is a sipper that develops nicely as it warms. Overall, this is a genre defining beer that might be the best example of an imperial IPA I’ve ever had.Jan 09, 2022"

L: 4.5. Deep amber-orange. Nearly opaque. Thin, creamy white head. Leaves behind alcohol lacing.

S: 4.75. Viney. Resinous. Grapefruit. Pine. Everything you want.

T: 5. This is a style defining beer. Great bitterness. Piney hops. Sweet, malty bite that becomes more apparent as it warms. Nothing negative to be said. Fiver.

F: 3.75. This is where this beer looses some points as it is quite heavy. There is a lite burn. Sip slowly and enjoy. 

O: 4.75. This is worth traveling to find. The hype is real for Lawson's. This may be their crown jewel.Jan 07, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25Look...Light copper yellow with little haze and thin carbonated head.

Smell....Smell of melon and over ripe fruit with pineapple also on the nose. light smell of citrus dank. Candied pine 

Taste...Melon sweet hop some burn, yum, A fullness of taste that has a piney resin with bitter sweet after. A complex and rich poignancy that lawson""s brings with the yeast.

Feel... Suck a thick fullness with the carbonation making it not appear sweet in the back. Excellent. 

Overall...This is very good just not the sort i seek out, so my bias is somewhat inherent in the review I suppose. Clearly that bias reflects somewhat in the score but ""Whata You gonna do"". I don't gamble on triple IPAs too much but this was worth it, and the caliber of brewery truly pulled my hand towards the purchase.Jan 02, 2022"

Honey sweetness, papaya, honeydew melon, some residual resinous bitterness. You can definitely feel the heat which is quite fusel. It's like an underpinning of some vodka or something, so it really has the taste of booze soaked fruit. A bit astringent on the finish. I think beer of this alcoholic magnitude should show the booze (so people aren't pretending how alcoholic this is), this does, but it does detract from the overall experience.Dec 31, 2021"

A more traditional looking golden appearance rather than hazy under a modest, fading white head.



Bold aromas of tropical fruits, citrus, dank, and resinous characters along with toasted bread crust and a hint of booze.



Medium mouthfeel.



Sweet and then those hop characters really jump forward and overtake everything. There is a slight booze burn at the finish and the booze seems a little more notable in the taste. Lingering finish.Dec 30, 2021"

Faintly hazy deep amber body. The loose bubbly head does not retain at all, hence no lacing. 



Strong tropical fruit aroma.



On tasting, bam!! Big grapefruit, pineapple and other mixed fruit flavors. Solid malt base adds a sweetness. Warming from the abv.



Mouth closer to full than medium, finish a sweet warm citrus bitterness, grapefruit leading the way.



Overall, while all the parts may not be stellar, the overall effect is very good indeed. It is also dangerously drinkable, so sipper beware.Dec 25, 2021"

I was happy to have this over sunset at a brewery. It just lacked something to make it a memorable beer. The dry hopping with Galaxy was pretty good but could be better. You could tell that the base beer (Fort Point) was awesome and saved the day.Oct 27, 2020"

Looks opaque, milky yellow with a frothy white head. 

Lots of hop aromas and flavors. Full and bursting with tropical fruit and citrus pulp character. Clear and direct, not a complex beer but the hops are full and strong.

Feels medium body, soft carbonation and juicy with little to no bitterness.



Overall really excellent. Glad I could pick some up!



I don't always knock points for style guidelines but I did here. Sure it's great and that's how they do things at Trillium but I like pale ales to be clear and crisp. It really should be qualified as a NE IPA but the brewery calls it a pale ale. I suppose the base beer without the double dry hop might be a little crisper, but still...Feb 29, 2020"

My first review of 2022! Yet another beer from my trade with merpunk1. This one is the highest rated Fruited Kettle Sour on BA, though it’s brewed more in the Berliner Weisse style, but whatever. It’s also currently sitting at #105 overall here, but I’m sure that’ll change soon given all the site updates as of late. Let’s pop this open



Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing



I really like what the guava does to this one in the nose, adding a nice funk. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe mango, funky guava, lemon juice, crackery malt, and light passion fruit



It’s even better in taste, still feeling unique in a world where this kind of thing is quite common. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon juice, funky guava, mango sorbet, crackery malt, passion fruit, and light orange juice. The swallow brings notes of tart passion fruit, orange juice, tart guava, apple skin, and pineapple



A light medium body pairs with aggressive tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and brisk beer. Finishes mostly dry and very tart



This is really good stuff, definitely worth trading for. I gotta get my hands on more of these J. Wakefield BerlinersJan 03, 2022"

This smells like lemon, lactic acid, sweet mango, guava, passionfruit, and citrusy funk.



This was probably earth shattering 5-6 years ago, when nothing like this existed. As it exists now, it's just a pleasantly tart fruited berliner with a semi-restrained fruit character, at least compared with the smoothie overload most breweries are doing these days. It's very drinkable, and you could easily see taking down a whole bottle of it if you so needed to.



This is light bodied, crisp, clean, and pleasantly sour on the finish, with a very nice drinkability.



This is most certainly overhyped, but it's still a well done and enjoyable beer through and through.Dec 14, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.2512 oz bottle, 2018 vintage, cellar treat, sent from Junior, into a Prairie Rastal glass. 



This marvelous beer pours a wonderful raisin color with a harvest gold head of 1/4 finger. Recedes to a polite fingernail and stays. Swirling leaves a few micro legs.



Aroma is that of a really settled-in beer. Like this one has had some time to really develop and mature into what it is. Tons of wonderful aged dates and raisins, with shoe leather, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and fig. Hints of chocolate, and a nice hot alcohol aroma envelopes the whole thing. 



Toffee and raisins start this one off, followed by a burnt char note and some piney hop, and then the sweetness returns with caramel and sticky fig, some paper/cardboard, and then fades out on tobacco and molasses. Very complex. A bit sharp and bitter, I'd prefer a little more smoothness, but this flavor profile is bonkers. 



Feel is sticky all the way to the bank with heat throughout but a cooling center. Moderate buzzing carbonation paired with warming alcohol that coats the gums and tongue. Leaves a bit of resin on the finish. 



Overall, this is a really wonderful barrel aged old ale and one I'd try to find again. I do believe I liked their BA stout better, but this is absolutely no slouch.

The nose, well, it's a very strong nose. Very boozy smelling. Lots of caramel, and toffee. Raisin, and dates as well. I'm also getting just a fain hint of coffee. 

Taste - Up front I get more of the dates and raisin. Tons of toffee, and that comes in on the backside, along with the caramel. Not really getting the coffee I was smelling. 

This beer isn't as boozy feeling as I was expecting. That being said, this beer is so thick, and full bodied. It actually goes down so smooth. 

World class stout, and so damn happy to try it.Apr 29, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net. 



Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes. 



In reality, this is an anachronism in 2022. It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago, but remains relevant because, at the end of the day, it's a damn good beer

look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Nearly clear amber brew with plenty of foam in the fat wheat beer glass. Lush with creamy carbonation. Malty and medium sweet. Aromatic with citrus and papaya. Taste is candied bitter orange, or marmalade. Very sippable and well made.



Hops are listed at Citra, Southern Cross, Nelson, and Pacific Jade. This DIPA bears the extra alcohol and malt well. A little of a hop overdose as you might expect. I have not had an Alpine beer in years so was happy to try one I had not seen. Brewed in San Diego. From the 16 oz can dated 10/25/21.Dec 17, 2021"

Continuing on with and nearing the end of my run of Russian River Wild Ales, we have the 9th highest rated of the style, and 104th overall. It seems that they’re really leaning heavily into the Americanized Lambic vibe with this one, so I’m interested to see if that holds true. Let’s find out



Pours a cloudy yellow gold with almost no head, just a ring of bubbles that leaves no lacing



Less than stellar looks aside, this one smells fantastic. I’m picking up on aromas of wet hay, white wine vinegar, acidic lemon juice, sharp oak, crackery malt, lime zest, white pepper, leather, and musty apple skin



Ok so the aroma was a knockout that had me expecting this to be super tart, but it leans into more of a restrained funk in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting apple skin, straw, lemon zest, old wood, white grape, and flowers. The swallow brings notes of white pepper, wet hay, old leather, apple skin, white wine vinegar, and light bready malt. Really good but pales in comparison to the aroma



A medium body pairs with gentle acidic carbonation, resulting in a crisp and funky beer. Finishes very dry with a slight tartness



This is good, but I suspect that, for some reason, 2 years on it has mellowed it out far too much. Seems odd for a Lambic-inspired beer, but based on reviews of fresh bottle this seems to have lost its bite. I'd love to try it fresh one day thoughMar 21, 2022"

Beer poured a cloudy golden with a little head that dissipated quickly.



Nose is very nice, very funky and horse blanket forward, along with some acidic vinegar qualities, true to the style.



Taste is a light malt base that has some lemon and apple. The funk, horse blanket, and touch of vinegar blend in very nicely without overwhelming the palate. Finishes tart.



Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and neither overly refreshing nor smooth.



Overall this was my first RR sour, and it is very nicely made!Jan 06, 2022"

Intro: 375 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend. 



Appearance: Golden yellow to light orange in color. Minimal to no head



Smell: Acidic is the first term that comes to mind. Second term, dank



Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Tart citrusy taste.



Mouthfeel: Cuts through everything. Definitely a pucker up front but subsides as you drink.



Drink: Follows along with mouthfeel. Not something I could drink a lot of at any given time



Conclusion: I’ve had more pleasing but I’ve also had a lot worse (for me). It’s pretty much one and done as with most wild ales with me.Jul 24, 2021"

I am a fan of Russian River, Pliny the Younger still eludes my taste buds. Living where I do, getting any beer worthy of writing home is difficult. I saw a bunch of Russian River's wild ales, I knew they had to come home with me. This is a sour beer aged in wine barrels. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a frothy white one-fingered head. The retention lasted maybe 15 seconds, leaving no lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 6, golden with amber hues. The beer is somewhat clear with a load of carbonation bubbles. 

Initial aromas in the beer are wine, funky barn, straw, damp earth, and lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, horse blanket, oak, a hint of floral, and a touch of herbal. 



The flavors in the beer are lemons, chardonnay, funky barn, horse blankets, straw, wheat, toasted crackers, a touch of apple cider, herbal, floral, and champagne-like flavor. 



The mouthfeel of the beer is tart, tannic, and bright. 



The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish. 



The beer has this explosion of sourness and funk. The wine barrel aging comes through pleasantly taking the edge off the sourness. I not sure if this my favorite offering from Russian River. This beer is a solid example of a wild ale, but I will not drink it again.Jun 16, 2021"

look: 2.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75Currently ranked #6 in the ""Wild Ale"" Top beers list and #70 in the Top Beers list with a perfect score of 100.



375ml brown glass bottle with hood-and-wire cap over a branded cork served chilled into a tulip (as indicated is ideal on the label and even on the cork). Bottled 04/03/20.



""100% spontaneously fermented beer aged in wine barrels."" ""Barrel aged 9 to 36 months"" (that's quite a spread...). ""...fermented beer using only wild yeast and bacteria."" 6.00% ABV.



HEAD: None really...just a floater ring that's rather thin and weak, dissipating in under 10 seconds.



BODY: Also a bit thin and weak, and certainly dull with a depleted and dareisay undercarbonated look.



I imagine I'm going to enjoy this beer, but we're kidding ourselves if this is a perfect 5 for appearance.



AROMA: Oak, barrel-derived vanillin, white wine, still cidre, obvious lactic acid. The bacterial aromatics are much more subdued than I imagined they'd be coming in...they register, but it's not teeming with lactobacillus like so many American brewed sour ales (I'm looking at you, Cascade Brewing). Doesn't seem as full of life and bacteria-ridden as, say, Allagash's coolship ales, but it's enticing with promises of ample barrel character, microfloral intricacy, and diverse bacteria.



I don't get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes finds in well-meaning sour ales and I find no signs of infection. Some green apple, sure, suggesting perhaps acetobacter. No vomit-redolent aromatics that would indicate butyric acid are present.



Aromatic intensity is average for the style, maybe even a bit on the timid side. Doesn't scream acidity, but it does seem acidic judging by the aroma.



TASTE & TEXTURE: Zaps with mellow acidity and puckering yet mellow bacteria, hitting on all fronts (pediococcus, brettanomyces yeast, and lactobacillus. Not a lactobomb, yielding to the lactobacillus without letting it dominate the beer's flavour profile.



I can't shake the feeling this would be better fruited. Some source of added sweetness would help counter its dry acidity; this lacks the tartness that often accompanies sourness and I think it's worse for it.



Smooth, smacky, deliberately undercarbonated (and to good effect, I might add, evoking a fine Brittany still cidre), a bit wet up front and a bit dry mid-body.



Oak and concomitant woodsy flavours tie the brew together without feeling in-your-face, but I could do with more barrel flavour myself...I'd guess this particular 2020 batch was aged closer to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claimed range, and that much to its detriment. I don't get barrel vanillin per se or rich toasted oak, and the wine character is decidedly lacking in terms of depth of flavour. I mean there's faint white wine - perhaps muted Chardonnay or Riesling - but it's not as overt or nuanced as I'd like.



Green apple/apple skins, orchard fruit, lime, rustic barnyard funkiness from well attentuated brettanomyces, scatterings of microflora (none of them as interesting as what one would find in a Senne valley sour), vinegar/acetic acid, grass, hay, maybe some faint clove/spice from aged hops.



I suppose the bacteria dominate. Maltwise, I don't get much beyond 2-row and maybe a kiss of Cantillon-like cereal grains. Far from a sweet ale, and I do think it'd be better off fruited as noted above.



OVERALL: It's not a holy shit son of a bitch ""man, you've got to try this!"" sour ale, and it's not even Russian River's best wine barrel aged sour ale (I'd tend to favour Supplication in that respect), but as an American imitation of Cantillon's spontaneously fermented sour ales, there's no doubt it's rather good, if not quite up there with the Allagash efforts in the category. I don't know that I'd shell out for it again at this price, but I'm glad to have gotten to try it. A long-time want and a damn solid ale, but I don't know that it beats the pants off your typical Belgian gueuze - many of which are easier to find than this and even as imports cost the same if not a biteen less.



I'm an unabashed Russian River fanboy, but while it's certainly rather good, the creme da la creme this is not, and how anyone can give this an honest to God perfect 100 rating given its obvious appearance issues (and what I imagine is to many troublesome undercarbonation) is beyond me.

Beer poured a pretty raspberry with a smallish white head that dissipated pretty quickly.



Nose is nice, berry forward, nice bouquet.



Taste is really well done; a substantial but light malt base combines nicely with the pinot noir barrel which lends the dark berry fruit flavor and a touch of tartness. The introduced Brett lends some funkiness. It finishes with a dry oak barrel.



Mouthfeel i s light bodied and very easy to sip.



Overall even thought my funky sour pallet is underdeveloped i can see this is a really well made beer as it is so flavorful and light and not overwhelming. Buy this if you like the style!Apr 26, 2022"

Last but most certainly not least in my lineup if Russian River Wilds is Supplication, the 8th highest rated of the style and 101st overall. It’s been a fun journey working through all of these, and I hope to drink them all again in the future. For now, let’s see what this one has to offer



Pours a opaque brownish orange with 2 fingers of off white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing



Wow, this is a full on assault in the nose and I’m loving it. I’m picking up on aromas of dark cherry, old leather, brown sugar, fresh oak, lemon yogurt, vanilla, rich red wine, light vinegar, caramel, and light plum



It is just so rich in taste, and not really the sour bomb you expect from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, tangy red wine, fresh oak, lemon juice, toffee, apple skin, wet hay, and light cellar. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, stewed dark fruit, red wine vinegar, blackberry, black pepper, brown bread, and pear skin



A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tangy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but tart enough to cut through most of it



This is a fantastic beer. It's certainly one of (if not the) best Russian River Wilds I had in this run, and it swings in the same class as the best of the style. So delicious but I'm sad that I've finished my last bottle!Mar 28, 2022"

Supplication

Russian River Brewing

Date: 21 November 2019

I will start my day with a wild ale; I have tried most of the sours from RRB, they have been phenomenal. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful. 

When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness. 

The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness. 

The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish. 

This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!Oct 16, 2021"

The aroma was what I had been craving. I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate. This was simply exquisite.Apr 10, 2021"

First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other ""specialty beers"" and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable. (Not a pro in the slightest and this is my 1st review, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I just had to put in my 2 cents because this is truly amazing.)Apr 05, 2021"

Pours a reddish amber with a cream colored head that leaves a ring of lacing. 



Nose of red wine, subtle candied cherry, caramel, mild grain, mild oxidation. 



Taste follows with a well blended red wine and candied cherries, oak follows with minimal grain, some oxidation but adds to the complexity of the beer. 



Feel is light with light carb and lingers on the pallet for medium length. 



Overall, this beer has held up incredibly well. Balance between candied cherry, and the pinot barrels is excellent. There is some oxidation, but do not think it is making this beer worse, but adds to the complexity.Mar 08, 2021"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.75Look: A deep reddish-orange hue.

Smell/Taste: The taste and smell are exactly what one would hope for in a wild ale. Some fantastic cherry sour taste and aroma, with the aged pinot and oak barrels providing some deep complexity

Feel: Some carbonation, but not too overpowering. 

Overall: This is one of my all time favorites. I had tried a number of wild ales before, but this is the on that got me hooked. Absolutely, a tremendous beerMar 06, 2021"

4.26/5  rDev -6.8%
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 | overall: 4750ml bottle, aged in oak barrels, undated, poured into a stemless wine glass. 



The beer pours a bright peach color, orange and gold hues, cloudy with a finger of fizzy white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. The aroma is wonderful, lots of fresh peach, bright and lightly tart with a nice floral quality, underlying fruitiness, lightly bacterial with a nice funk, soft oak and earthiness. The flavors are great, tons of peach, juicy, fresh, bright and tart with a nice oak barrel, sweet and chewy with a nice mustiness and funkiness while a soft floral bouquet opens up as it warms. The mouthfeel is good, coating with a delicate and lively medium body that has a nice tartness and finishes with a lightly dry bite.



Verdict: A nice wild ale from de Garde. Lots of peach, bright, fresh, just a touch sweet that really demonstrates the great qualities of the peach.Jan 16, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4Bless my friends at Tavour for delivering this to my door (eventually). Imbibed a few samples at a local beer festival this spring & happy to finally have it from a bottle on my comfortable couch. Split with my stout-guzzling wife. 



Black. After a brief, wispy, half-bald head rises on the pour, it’s 100% gone two minutes later, looking still & sinister. A beer to drown your enemies in (but what a waste…maybe drown your friends?). The nose is coconut & endless malts. 



Medianoche – Coconut is thicker than my Sunday waffle batter. Borderline gummy chewable. Taste-wise it’s a simpler beer than I expected. I scoffed at the ‘brownie batter’ description but it’s on the mark & right up front. Well, batter with a shot of bourbon mixed in right after the eggs. Extended cut of coconut, pinch of brown sugar, serious malty sweetness throughout. Given a 10:30 AM wakeup time & a couple hours I’d love to take one of these solo. 



Just what I expect from this line of stouts. Thick, sweet, heavy barrel, delicious. Excellent beer.Aug 06, 2022"

Rich aroma; dark chocolate and roasted coffee; coconut. Enormous flavors of milk chocolate, fudge; coconut and bourbon; faint maraschino cherry and peppermint suggestion; subliminal earthy spiciness in the background. Dense, sludgy mouthfeel; heavy slipperiness; incredible residual sugar presence; syrupy; low-level alcohol warmth in the background.



What hath these brewer's created? Sure, a rather dark and dull appearance but the smell characteristics pick things up. Then, you come to the taste and mouthfeel. Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick! What an awe-inspiring experience. The depth, richness and complexity are nearly out of this world. A beer one needs to experience to fully appreciate what mere words struggle to convey.

look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5No vintage or ABV info on the bottle, but this is the aged Blanton's barrels for 21-24 months version. This looks and feels like stout gravy, I mean this is gelatinous. I can't quite decide if this is too much of a good thing or not. Does anyone else wonder if brewers add corn starch to some of these thicker beers? Weirdly, what few bubbles I could coax from a vigorous pour seemed to exist under the surface. 



This is massively, absurdly flavorful. I can't pick all that much out of this, just heaps of bittersweet chocolate and coconut for the most part. I do get a little bourbon but no barrel character otherwise. Very enjoyable.



Edit, there was a weird 2 in long lump at the bottom of my glass. Gross, lowering some scores.Apr 07, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 52021 version aged in Blanton’s. Crazy thickness just sticks to the glass. Anchorage Blessed thick. Shiny film on top let’s you know there’s a bunch of fresh coconut. Nose is heavy dark chocolate, bourbon, wood, coconut. First sips are a shot of motor oil with all those flavors. The Blanton’s brings a darkness to the already heavy malt stout. There’s a tiny hint of bourbon bite, but cut by the coconut sweetness. Definitely a sipper with this viscosity. No noticeable carbonation, just still black goodness. Fortunate to have gotten this by Tavour.



Honestly, Thin Man’s Recent Blanton’s BA Coconut Jenkins gives this a run for its money. Their’s is a little brighter, a little less viscous, but on par IMO.Apr 04, 2022"

Pours deep, deep black and very oily thick with absolutely no carbonation and no head whatsoever. At the end of my pour, a thin sheen of copper colored beer glistened on the top. The smell is incredible -- the bourbon barrel comes through strongly with notes of chocolate, cinnamon and coconut. The taste is rich, deeply, deeply chocolate with cinnamon, vanilla notes and coconut as well. There is a strong resemblence to brownies laced with alcohol as well as to a rich creme brulee. A noteworthy taste extravaganza.Apr 02, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5The coffee-coconut was one of my beers of the year last year, from that point onward wanted to try this one. Viscous black body with a short lived brown cap. Nose is laced with bourbon backed dark chocolate with coconut, vanilla, brownie batter, with undercurrents of molasses, roasted malt, oak, and a kiss of cinnamon. Taste is much the same with the huge chocolate, bourbon, coconut and gourmet vanilla, but I find the coffee not being there to cut the sweetness over time hurts this one. This is especially true in the feel, where the heavy, thick, boozy, and massive mouthfeel doesn't do anything to stop sweetness from building. Still a great stout, but the sweetness does add up over time, share the bottleApr 02, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5750 ml wax capped bottle, 2021 edition (aged in Copper & Kings grape brandy barrels for a year, then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels), 21.8% ABV, bottled 01/19/21. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is! Certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!Jul 23, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Review #8000, 2015 vintage. This will be a very emotional review. Normally for big milestones like this, rudzud would have some crazy beer to share, but that can't happen now. Instead this was one from our share box that we got from Hoarders, saving for a special day. He might not be here physically to share it with me, but he's here in spirit.



Pours basically with no head, whisp of fizzy bubbles disappears almost instantly, dark murky molasses brown color with no real light coming through, and legs for days



Nose brings lots of barrel and bourbon, lots of vanilla oak, a bit buttery oak, fresh bourbon barrel juice, a bit like my nose in a Glencairn glass with some decent bourbon, lots of dark malts under that, some roast and coffee, no char, loads of cocoa, dark chocolate, a little nougat candy bar, fudge, a bit of a chocolate syrup as well, a little alcohol



Taste super rich heavy malts and barrel, dark chocolate, raw cocoa, chocolate syrupy again, a bit of a candy bar with light nougat and caramel notes, some roast and coffee as well, more like a coffee syrup, barrel brings lots of vanilla again and fresh bourbon barrel juice, a little generic whiskey character but some raw sweet bourbon as well, getting fudgey in the middle, some toasted oak character and layers of vanilla, a touch of baking spice, med lighter bitterness mostly from the roasted malts, some hot alcohol not quite fusel but almost there, finishes sticky and coats the mouth, never really goes away, lingering cocoa, fudge, vanilla and generic whiskey



Mouth is full bod, rich syrupy and really coats the mouth, some hot tingly alcohol, med-light foamy carb



Overall quite nice, there have been better Bruery beers, but for a Black Tuesday variant adding the extra bourbon and barrel was nice, although I think it has dropped a bit from what it probably was fresh, but alcohol didn't destroy either as the age probably helped there. 



I swear I heard a pop sound from my glass while it was resting and I was typing. Matt must have taken his sip, and I hope he enjoyed it. Miss the great bottle shares and fun times. This was just one more milestone in my reviews. I know rudzud always joked about how he would never catch me in reviews, and I guess he was right. I'll keep drinking beers, but I'll always have that hole that will never be filled. Cheers Matt!Jan 23, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75Very good head production, considering the sky high ABV and double barrel aging. Quickly fades, as expected, leaving behind only a thin ring of foam around the edge. Body is surprisingly clear and cola-colored.



Boozy nose - whoda thunkit? The smell of bourbon, port, and brown sugar wafts over you from the pour itself. Up close it's similar but stronger: red grape, molasses, chocolate, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, honeycomb.



Strong, sweet, and boozy on the palate, with an alcoholic burn that grows and grows. Very slow sipper. Lasting heat in the throat and chest.



Incredibly deep and complex, rich and dark. Molasses, brown sugar, oak, bourbon mash, red grape, white bread, light toast, toffee, vanilla, espresso. Long aftertaste, although the booze understandably dissipates rather quickly.Dec 20, 2020"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.752022 batch, 13.6% ABV.



Pours a nearly pitch-black color. Befitting a huge, barrel-aged monster, there isn't much head, just a tan collar topping it off. 



The aroma, though, is out of this world good. The focus here is on roasted malt, espresso, licorice, and baker's cocoa. A light touch of smoke gives it another layer of depth. There's a tiny hint of cinnamon lingering around, which is good: too much cinnamon would have hurt its chances at greatness. And of course, the assertive bourbon barrels can't be overlooked. Tons of oak, vanilla, and bit of corn shine through. 



While the taste doesn't follow the nose super-close, it's wonderful in its own way. It starts off with a nice, sweet cinnamon flavor lacking the bitter spice of other (frankly lesser) cinnamon-adorned beers. Same with the bourbony finish: it's subtle yet noticeable, without being massively assertive. Dark chocolate, espresso, roast, and licorice round out the middle - again, enough to make you think, but not enough to overpower. There's a ton of stuff going on with this one, and actually coalesces together into something harmonious and complex instead of complicated and sloppy. The more I consume, the more I love it, therefore it earns an elusive 5 taste-wise. 



It's not as texturally slick or slimy as other big oatmeal stouts, but by no means is it bone-dry. I could use a touch more body and thickness, but that's me nitpicking for the sake of picking nits. It's still as creamy and decadent as one could want from a monster barrel-aged stout. Carbonation is low, but it doesn't need much anyways since the oak tannins cleanse the palate decently. 



I'm always that guy saying beer X doesn't live up to the hype or wondering how the hell beer Y earned a 100. This, though, this lives up to the hype and then some. It's one of the most complex stouts I've ever sampled, and - like I said - isn't complex in a ""some is good, therefore too much is even better"" kind of way. It's wonderfully cohesive and well-rounded in a way stouts not even a fourth as deep are. An absolute masterpiece, seek it out yesterday!Aug 14, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Look: like an imp stout should. Deep and dark. Some slight ruby/cola highlights around the edges when held to light. Modest mocha head on the pour that mostly recedes. Some oily, messy lacing that doesn’t stick around long.

Smell: cinnamon up front on a bed of roasty, bourbon, dark chocolate.

Taste: cinnamon and chocolate sweetness up front, countered by a nice roasty, slightly bitter char in the finish.Jun 09, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Sampling this 2021 vintage 22 oz bottle poured into my trusty snifter. Beer is part of a swap with @Resistance88 thank you!

The beer pours a thick , jet black coffee color with a dense brown head foaming up about 2 cm and gently cresting over the edge of my glass. No spillage out and no light passing through either. Looks the part of an imperial stout for sure.

the dense creamy head fades slowly to a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense coating lattice on each sip or swirl of the glass.

The aroma on this beer is complex and enticing, there is some dark chocolate and a bit of roasted malts and almost charred note. I also definitely get cinnamon, but its not artificial like Big Red, very earthy cinnamon note. Also some bourbon notes come through here. I dont get licorice that is on the label, which is okay as I dont tend to like anice/licorice aroma or flavor too much. I dont get any booze here which is impressive at 13.3%. Also not much if anything for a hop profile on the nose.



First sip reveals a full, thick body with soft gentle and fine carbonation. Beer feels nice on my palate and does give a bit of a coating on my lips with each sip.

Flavor follows the notes advertised on the nose. I get dark chocolate and some bourbon with hints of dark chocolate rolling through. Some warming and earthy cinnamon pops up, and this flavor lingers along with a bit of warmth, or is THAT the abv which was hidden on the nose?? Not really any char or heavy roast notes here. The bourbon does come back very dominant on the burps. Hops, we dont need no stinkin hops! I dont get any on the flavor profile.

So the warmth could be booze or cinnamon, its not hot, just slightly warm.

The beer does drink pretty easy for its heft and I do enjoy it a lot. I got a second bottle of another beer to open after this, but I may just sip this one all night.

Very good brew!May 21, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Pour as black as black can be and the light brown head was sparse, short and faded quickly.

The aroma spoke more of bourbon than oatmeal, which is typical, (Oatmeal generally affects to feel more than the flavor for me in most cases) but I wasn't sure what to expect. The malts were very present, rich and deep. Strong coffee, cinnamon and bakers cocoa all made their appearance.

Taste followed, no new surprises awaited me except the sheer level of flavors that came at me. The prior BA stout today I could have (and would have) consumed a bomber of, but this one somehow go through to me rational mind that finishing it tonight would not be wise. So I'm testing the bottle sealer that so many have recommended.

The feel was pretty typical BA stout, as the bottle was from 2019 it may have lost a bit of it's carbonation but that didn't spoil anything for me.Apr 17, 2022"

Alright, I've obtained the highest rated Oatmeal Stout! This title used to of course belong to Founders Breakfast Stout, but the restructuring of BA rankings shifted it to this. I am very excited to dive into this massive beast, which is also my first beer from Fremont. Let's see what this is all about



Pours pitch black with 2 fingers of dark brown head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing



Oh man, even after 2 years the cinnamon in this thing is still super prevalent. I'm picking up on aromas of cinnamon bark, milk chocolate, caramel, toasted oak, spicy bourbon, light char and black licorice. Very earthy and raw



The earthy and spicy notes from the aroma is still present in taste, but it focuses much more on the smoother, somewhat sweet notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, fruity coffee, earthy cinnamon, caramel, toasted oak, and light raisin. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, spicy bourbon, dark chocolate, black licorice, dark cherry, molasses, and spent coffee beans



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy and lightly zesty beer. Finishes slightly sticky but dries over time. Decadent but not overly sweet



This is a fantastic beer. It is incredibly creamy, balanced, and complex. I would love to know what this is like fresh but this is a treat regardlessFeb 21, 2022"

Been chasing it for over a decade and happy to score a few back in 2020 and sitting on them for about a year and a half. Super sweet but not cloying, roasty and smoky without being off-putting. Pretty boozy in the nose, signifying it could use even more time to mellow. Luckily I have another bottle for years down the road. So smooth and easy-drinking but SO full of complex flavors. The best flavor in the finish is roasted marshmallows, without a doubt. Such a fun beer to drink. Epic stuff.Feb 15, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.252021 Limited Release. Found quite a few of these Fremont gems at Albany, Oregon Winco. Poured from a wax sealed 20 oz into a 16oz glass. 



Look: poured nearly black with almost no head. 



Smell: notes of licorice and dark chocolate with a little bit of coffee. 



Taste: one of the most intense and smoothest aged oatmeal stouts that I have ever had. No “cough syrup” sting, but notes of licorice, chocolate, and cherry. Nice finish, very smooth. 



Feel: smooth and bold. 



I am a huge fan of Fremont, so there is some bias. In winters past, my wife loved barrel aged imperial stouts, so this type of “beer” is familiar. This is intense. I’m half way through the bottle (by myself) for dinner and it continues to be an enjoyable sipping beer that will have me in good spirits for the rest of the night. I’m interested in the other bottles of limited release after enjoying this.Jan 03, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.752020 vintage. Received from @snaotheus in the NBS BIF #14. Poured into a snifter at 63°. It pours an oily black with a half finger of creamy, medium-mocha head and thin coating of lacing. Very pretty. Its smell offers roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt coffee, pepper, earthy char, and a strong bourbon aroma. The taste is sublime! Like a dessert. It features dark chocolate, oatmeal, cinnamon, burnt coffee, anise, and a strong dose of bourbon. The flavors are distinct but blend magnificently. The result is delicious. The mouth feel is terrific: thick and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and the 13.3% ABV is warming but not distracting. Overall, The Rusty Nail is a magnificent Oatmeal Stout; the best example of the style I've had. It excels in all categories. I'm grateful to have had the chance to enjoy it.Dec 19, 2021"

Though I enjoy drinking socially, I do most of my drinking solo, which makes those 16 oz plus bottles a challenge. That might be the wimpiest thing I've said this week. I should probably go start my lawnmower in one pull to make up for that. As for the flavor, both the coconut and vanilla come through, but hold back from dominating the flavor profile. I liken it to Phil Anselmo holding back in Cemetery Gates, unleashing at just the right time. It goes without saying, but drink this one slowly, as the flavor profile changes as it warms.

Dark seal brown to bistre body with a thin fawn/camel collar. Vague lacing; fast running legs; poor retention. 



Vanilla, barrel char, bourbon, roast malt, and a hint of tobacco, molasses, cocoa, and toffee in the nose. 



Intense palate entry - all of the flavors above but concentrated. Rather sweet, with a long chocolate-laden finish. Some barrel/alcohol elements along with a gentle, clean bitterness add a little balance. Stewed dark fruit notes emerge as the ale warms. Neutral yeast character. Coconut and vanilla seem a little redundant, overwhelming their counterparts in the bourbon flavor, and reinforcing the borderline cloying impression.



Silky, almost oily, rich mouth-feel with active yet low carbonation. Moderately warming.



More on the dessert end of the spectrum for the style, but very potent with some balanced barrel influence. Enjoyed it more than my notes might suggest.Mar 13, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 4.252019 version enjoyed 27 months later.



Pours pitch black with a finger of fizzy, dark mocha, almost reddish head that fizzes away almost instantly. When swirled, it coats the glass with a dark film.



Aroma is light coconut and even lighter vanilla as expected from the extended aging. This allows the base stout and barrel to shine more. Dark chocolate, black cherry, tobacco, roasted malt, some peat, and molasses from the base and some charred oak and bourbon from the barrel.



Taste brings more of the adjuncts than expected given the aroma, but they're still quite light given today's ""pastry stout"" standards. Toasted coconut and light vanilla bean dance in the background while the barrel treated stout is at the forefront. Bakers chocolate, some bittersweet chocolate chip, roasted malt, some peat, tobacco, black cherry, some fig, molasses, some brown sugar, charred oak, bourbon spirit. I'm sure there's some vanillin and even possibly some coconut coming from the barrel, but it's hard to tell if that character is from the adjuncts or the barrel.



Medium to high medium body. Slick, oily, sticky, warming. Could use a bit more body. Doesn't drink like 16%, but you know you're drinking a big beer.



I know I shouldn't have sat on this as long as I did because I'm sure there was a lot more coconut and vanilla character; however, the base and barrel integration are top notch and allowing the adjuncts to subside has shown this. It also has led to what I'd imagine is a smoother drinking experience than when it was fresher. I'm sure a fresher version of this would meet my expectations more, but this is still a very enjoyable beer at where it's currently at.Jan 30, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4Poured a black body with minimal head and touch of lace patches but those quickly dissipate. The aroma is mostly booze to me, although some sugariness comes in as well so assume this is vanilla. Smooth beer, kind of buttery it's so slick, with a hot and boozy taste and feel with vanilla sweetness but also some slickness from hints of coconut. Real easy to drink for a slow sipper and there is a good amount of chocolate throughout the beer that balances well with the vanilla and coconut.Sep 30, 2021"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4BBA imperial (13.7% abv) stout featuring vanilla and coconut...



Nothing wrong here, but its an unexceptional take on the style - that said, yes - you get bourbon, you get vanilla, and you get coconut, too - high-abv stout body with appropriate chocolatiness and coffee - maybe I'm just jaded - this 12 oz. bottle was $9.99 IIRC - Prairie being notoriously high-priced (right? lol) - so in sum, you get what they advertise, but to my tastes it doesn't do anything with the ingredients that elevates it above peer drinks, or to justify the price... Fans of vanilla and coconut BBA stouts will absolutely dig this though...Sep 19, 2021"

Too much upon the first sip. Of course, after the initial shock your taste buds acclimate a bit. But overall, this ale goes too far with is coconut, vanilla, and sweetness. Thought the barrel-aging contributes to these faults I do not believe that’s where the mistakes were made. 3.5



A – Pours an opaque oily black, viscous with zero head. Syrupy. An alcohol “wedge” (not legs) on the glass. 4.25



S – Sweet, vanilla, bourbon barrel, coconut is on the faint side and seems to be overwhelmed by the other aromas. There are some roasted aromas as well, but behind everything else. A very complex aroma. 4.0



T – Coconut!!! Sweet. Alcohol is well hidden. No bitterness. Sweetness is a combo of the coconut and the brown sugar flavors. No spiciness to balance, just the ABV. 3.5



MF – Heavy bodied, sweet with a spirited finish, but not hot. 3.75Aug 29, 2021"

750ml bottle - blend 5 - poured into a chalice at 50°F. 



Pours a clear, deep straw-golden hue, with just a cast of unfiltered fog, and a finger of creamy, soft, off-white head, eventually settling to a thick collar leaving some lacing behind. Visible effervescence.



Nose: Soft, pale rustic grains, with crackery wheat and some round malted barley lend secondary notes of wet hay, dewy grass, and some dusty silo. There is some remarkable floral character, lending spring blossoms like lilac and hyacinth, with lemon blossom, wet stony minerality, and a lightly musty oakiness. Some very restrained white vinous notes, along with a touch of pear, apple, and apricot. Gentle hints of honey, lemon zest, and some phenolic peppery notes wrap it all up in a beautifully soft and rustic olfactory display.



Palate: Saison du Fermier greets the palate with simultaneous waves of gentle lemony tang, semi-sweet grist with some crackery, bready, and rustic grainy notes, and an explosion of bright, shimmery fruity notes. Lemon, nectarine, apricot, tart white plum, green apple, Asian pear, and a sweet-tart balance of fruity white grape. There's a bright but balanced minerality pushing these flavours to the front, along with some wet limestone. Some Belgian-like saison yeast brings that fruity, undertone with a bit of peppery spice intermingling with a touch of herbal hops. Finish is oaky, dry, and lightly tannic.



Mouthfeel/Body: It's on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a tight, snappy crispness - bright and fluid, but there's enough grain to lend some softness and presence. Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy, but fine enough to stay soft and fluffy. Tart and wet up front, finishing with an increasingly dryness, and a touch of cling.



Overall: A lot of the fruited and more recent Side Project offerings have been trending more and more acidic, which can really bring it down fast. This one shows the balance and softness that I know they're capable of. It retains much of that classic Belgian saison character, while contributing the classic Side Project culture and grist character. Soft, balanced, bright, and absolutely dialed in. A top tier American oak-aged saison.Feb 17, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Aged bottle. Jet black with hints of brown shading, brown cap. This one is more fitting of the dark lord moniker as it doesn't hold anything back. Huge bourbon booze starts the nose with chocolate fudge, roasted malt, coffee, solid rustic oak, molasses, dried dark fruit, and vanilla. Taste is much the same as the nose but not as nuanced, barrel stays strong, vanilla steps up, caramel enters in, dark fruit fades away. Feel is big, boozy and dark, just what they are going for, even with some age it still bites. I'm sure this will be controversial but I like the non-ba version better as an all around RIS, but when in the mood for a beast of a beer this will suffice, tough certainly on the sweeter endNov 28, 2020"

4.35/5  rDev -4.6%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25I've been chasing this beer for a while now - bottle counts always seem lower than other adjuncted variants, and no one seems to want to let one go. So, finally caught it on tap this year!



The beer obviously changes a bit in the barrel (see all of the variants) - what once was a cloyingly unpleasant, overly sweet beer turns in to a much more balanced, not-insultingly sweet beer that almost has a sort of buttery taste and aroma to it. It's thick and rich, of course, with lightly disguised bourbon. This feels like a trick. I almost wondered whether I had the right beer.



It's great - it still lets me down a bit, after these years of chasing... still, great.Jun 04, 2019"

4.9/5  rDev +7.5%
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5Appearance - The beer poured dark color with a creamy mocha head topping off the pour. 



Smell - The sweetness of Dark Lord met with bourbon. The nose was sweet, but not cloying.



Taste - What made this beer great was the sense of balance. The cloying, soy sauce-like, sweetness that many associate with regular Dark Lord is balanced with bourbon. What became of the combination is smooth sticky heat. 



Mouthfeel - The beer was silky smooth with light carbonation and a slick sweetness. The body did not seem as thick as some of the other variants. 



Overall - It is amazing what a plain bourbon barrel will do to Dark Lord.May 19, 2019"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Cloudy orange with a fat finger of dense, off-white foam head. Good retention and thick lacing.



Big pineapple aroma with tropical Starburst, dank jungle weed and mango beneath.



Pineapple-forward taste as well, coupled with an interesting herbal note that lends some slight bitterness in the finish. There was fairly strong Playdoh in there at first, too; it might have been connected to the head, because it faded after the first few sips.



Full bodied with fairly zippy carbonation.



Lots of fantastic elements in this. The Playdoh was a huge let down at first, but again, that off-flavor didn’t last too long.Feb 03, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Holy cow was my reaction to seeing this. It poured very thick. Orange color. 2 finger white head. The head retention is amazing, considering the ABV. Beautiful lacing on the glass. 

The nose is well, fairly minimal. Which surprises me. I'm just getting a faint citrus from it. Just a hint of pineapple, and grapefruit. Very minimal. 

Taste - Now the taste is another thing all together from the aroma. This is a VERY hoppy beer. There's just a ton of citrus in it. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange - all there. Tons of hops in the flavor. 

This beer is thick as heck here, which doesn't surprise me one bit. The hops just cling to my throat, and don't let go at all.

While this beer is light in the aroma department, it more than makes up in every other category. Another damn solid beer from Other Half.Apr 08, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Oh man, I’m excited for this one. My last beer from my latest run to Tree House, and one that hasn’t been released in many years. Currently sitting at #84 of all time on BA, we have a straight up, no adjunct barrel aged Stout blend. Let’s crack open this special bottle



Pours nearly pitch black and still, with just a small layer of tan bubbles than quickly fade to a thin ring that leaves no lacing but nice legs



While I appreciate this not having the typical TH Stout sweetness in the nose, it’s not as complex as I had hoped though still good. I’m picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and raisin



It is sweet in taste, but not in any cloying way, rather it is kept wonderfully in check by many complex notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting milk chocolate, plum, vanilla, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, black cherry, and burnt caramel. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, boozy bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, black cherry, pecan, toasted oak, and dark roast coffee



A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sweet beer. Finishes sticky and heavy but not overwhelmingly sweet



So this is very good, but I wouldn't consider it among the best of the best. Regardless, it was super fun to try, and a nice beer to wind down withJun 19, 2022"

Gentle pour brings a pure jet black motor oil color with a finger of caramel head. Good retention for the style. Leaves a halo of lacing around the glass. Settles into a thin film laid carefully across the beer.



The aroma brings strong notes of bourbon, dark fruits, caramel, dark chocolate, and pecans with loads of vanilla, oak, toffee, dark roast coffee beans, light char and a bit of smoke.



The flavor has tons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chip cookies. There's loads of Hazelnut coffee, toasted pecans and almonds, as well as bourbon, vanilla, oak, fig, plum and caramel. Boozy but at 12.3% this should be expected. A lot going on here but it all works perfectly together.



The feel is full bodied, chewy and syrupy. Almost no carbonation but plenty of booze, as expected.



Overall, I might be a Tree House fanboy but I've been quite critical of their stouts in recent years. They've become a bit too sweet with minimal balance. Just chocolate syrup. This bad boy, however, is one of the rare barrel aged stouts they have. Fortunately, I didn't pay anything for the beer as the bottle was shared with a friend.



This is definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. The bourbon is certainly present, but doesn't overpower the beer like other BA stouts. It's sweet, but nowhere near cloying. Boozy, but not overly so.May 13, 2022"

Layers of flavor and complexity here. Mouthfeel was THICK. Sludgy oil down my gullet. Mouth coating to say the least. Tiny bubbles of carbonation danced on my tongue. Overall, this is an outstanding non adjunct BA offering. Really impressed with this as a non blended barrel aged offering from Tree House.

Review #2100



Medium bodied dark brown/black appearance. Somewhat thinner in appearance and lighter in color than I anticipated. The beer was topped by a small cap of bubbly, cappuccino colored froth that quickly broke apart. A medium sized halo encircled the liquid.



The aroma was solid initially but somewhat subtle. Malty notes dominated. Roasted malts were most apparent. Good dose of caramel malt character too. Moderately sweet. Slightly smoky. Almost a touch peaty. Dark fruits were also detectable. Raisins, plums and figs perhaps. There was a bit of a papery oxidative quality as well, but this subsided with time. As the beer sat, the aroma intensified. The dark fruits, the sweetness and the smoke became notably punchier.



The flavor profile followed the nose. Rich and malty up front but less intense than anticipated. Nice melding of roasted and caramel malts. Slightly smoky. Boozy notes kicked in as the beer moved along the palate. Port soaked raisins came to mind. There was a bit of a chocolate/Tootsie Roll-like character too. Subtle metallic notes appeared on the back end, but they dissipated with time. More lingering booze and sweetness on the finish.



The mouthfeel was solid but thinner bodied for a beer of this magnitude. Smooth and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence that fluffed up nicely on the palate.



Tree House make some amazing adjuncted milk stouts, but their purely barrel-aged releases seem to be a bit lacking in intensity and mouthfeel. While this was an enjoyable beer, it did little to stand apart from the pack.Jun 29, 2021"

Alright, time for the highest rated American Strong Ale, which is quite the ambiguous style, but I’m excited regardless. Especially after having The Rusty Nail and knowing they excel at using cinnamon as an adjunct, I can’t wait to try this. Let’s get into it



Pours a very dark brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing



This is super cinnamon forward in the nose, almost too much but it’s still nice. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, spicy whiskey, and toasted oak



It’s a bit more balanced in taste, and very good, but I was expecting this to pop more. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, toasted oak, earthy cinnamon, raisin, earthy whiskey, brown sugar, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, sweetened coffee, milk chocolate, toasted oak, caramel, and bourbon. Gets better as it warms but I wanted more complexity out if it



A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a lush yet zippy beer. Finishes dry for everything going on and drinks well below the 13% listed



Given the fact that it improves over the course of drinking it, I have to bump this one up a bit in the overall. Still not everything I was hoping for but very goodMay 01, 2022"

Aged (4 years? or nearly 5?) in my cellar and served chilled in a Chimay chalice. Oil slick appearance and a big warm cinnamon nose that fills the room. Really that aroma is hard to beat. Flavor is creamy and mouth-encompassing with waves of caramel, cinnamon candy. Ultra-fine carbonation adds milkiness to the mouthfeel. Mocha and coffee flavors are initially mellowed but there's a more pronounced coffee bitterness in the aftertaste. Vanilla flavors from the bourbon are also mellow, and I don't get any harsh whisky flavor at all. Pretty amazing for 13.0% ABV. World-Class absolutely describes it. I don't believe I've ever had this fresh, but I have no regrets about aging it this long.Dec 26, 2021"

Pours out a dark brown, nearly black liquid. Aggressive pour yields a half of a finger of khaki head. The foam sticks around for a while. It didn't look too thick on the way into the glass. Stouts just have a certain way of looking and you can guess that this might not be one.



Nose indicates that it's definitely not a stout. Coffee comes forward first, but not in your face with roasty qualities. There's actually a slight hint of sweet fruitiness that accompanies this coffee. Reminds me of Jamaican Blue with its delicate, fruit-forward tones. Next is the presence of molasses spice cookie. There's this mildly bitter, peppery, spicy sort of thing lurking underneath. It smells quite captivating so far, if a little on the weak side. 



Taste is everything that was in the nose and more. A natural evolution. Mildly roasty and fruity coffee, cinnamon, bitter black strap molasses, a faint bourbon/oak, black pepper, but without the heat, and dark grainy bread. Along the lines of rye or pumpernickel. I got that in the previous B-Bomb I had as well. Very unique quality. These flavors unravel spectacularly, never once stepping over each others toes or vying for attention. Nicely balanced, not too bitter, not sickly sweet. 



Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Not thick like a stout, but a nice density. Not too cloying, alcohol evaporation drying it up a little. Mild carbonation.



Overall a fantastic brew for the winter. A great sipper to have with friends and to ponder life and enjoy a snowy winter landscape. Cheers to Fremont who continuously knocks it out of the park.Dec 24, 2021"

This is well rounded and wonderfully balanced overall. The barrel presence is magnificent, no surprise from Fremont, rich with bourbon and mellow vanilla with hints of oaky leather. I want my funeral pyre built with spent staves from Fremont barrels.



Under all that was creamy cocoa, dates and raisins, caramel, subtle coffee, and dessert like cinnamon. This is wonderful as is, but I hope I get to try a fresh bottle someday with more assertive coffee notes.



Now having 2018, aged and purchased under the same circumstances. This version was a few bucks cheaper for some reason. This was drier and a bit roastier. Less cinnamon and surprisingly more coffee maybe. Just a bit less decadent than the 2019.



Edit 4/1/22 got my wish, now enjoying a fresh 2022 bottle. The coffee is more assertive but so is the cinnamon. I'm also getting a strong coconut note. Huge barrel presence but the figs , cocoa, and raisins are subdued. It's wonderful now, but I think I'll age the other for a year or so.Oct 10, 2021"

S: Light to moderate aromas of bourbon, coffee and cinnamon are present in the nose, the latter of which becomes stronger as the beer warms up.

T: The taste follows the smell and has additional notes of vanilla from the bourbon barrel aging. No alcohol is perceptible.

M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. The cinnamon lends hints of heat in the finish.

O: This beer does a very good job at balancing all of the flavors together and is exceptionally easy to drink considering its strength.

L -- Black with a small khaki-hued head produced with moderate pour. Minimal retention and some lacing

S -- Cinnamon, smokey oak, caramel, dark chocolate, bourbon, herbal bitters, hint of ground coffee

T -- Despite the two years of aging on this one, the coffee and cinnamon character are both there and round out the soft bourbon barrel notes very nicely. No angles are too harsh here. Also getting dark chocolate, vanilla nougat, herbal hop

F -- Medium+ mouthfeel, medium- carb. Not overly boozy or bitter

O -- The aging did wonders with this

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 52019

Appearance: impenetrable dark mahogany color tending to black, creamy beige foam with excellent persistence. Flawless.

Smell: cinnamon, caramel, chocolate, coffee, leather, vanilla, wood, bourbon. Elegance and balance.

Taste: molasses and caramel, chocolate, cinnamon, roasted notes of coffee and malt, vanilla, hints of wood, leather, tobacco, bourbon. Aftertaste of Christmas cake with chocolate and coffee sprinkled with cinnamon.

Feeling: cinnamon pleasantly pinches a round and velvety drink constantly embraced by a gentle ethyl heat of bourbon. A disarming balance between sweetness and bitterness. An elegant aging in barrels.

Body: full but not bulky nor chewable, round and soft, medium and fine carbonation.Apr 17, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle (2017 vintage) into a small tasting glass



L: pours a nice very dark black brown with a moderate tan khaki head. Fades after a minute or so, leaves a nice ring of foam around the edge when it does



S: nice and inviting nose, full without coming across heavy or sweet. Great chocolate aroma to open, solid roast coffee comes through as well. There’s a bit of cinnamon spice coming through as well, adds some nice complexity but doesn’t become a dominant note. A bit more cinnamon as it’s warmed, along with a small bit of abv heat



T: follows the nose well, a great dark chocolate note with dark roast coffee notes shining as well. That cinnamon comes through to add some nice depth, but again more playing a supporting role than really acting as a main flavor. This was as it was cold from the fridge - as it’s warmed that cinnamon comes through more, still not aggressive but a nice addition to the chocolate. Medium-long finish, with a nice bitter coffee/dark chocolate coming through. Abv works very well, provides that warming character without coming across hot



F: medium body, medium carbonation, would have liked it a bit thicker but not sure if that’s me thinking stout vs. winter warmer (what is the appropriate body for the style?)



O: a really nice winter warmer (not that I’ve had many in the style). Solid nose, great flavor - some age in the bottle has muted the adjuncts but I’d say they still come through wellApr 11, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75A: black pour, almost stout-like. Includes a very dark head to boot. Head dissipates quickly like most barrel aged brews.



S: cinnamon and lots of it. Bit of sugary caramel from the barrel.



T: wow! Again, loads of cinnamon both in flavor and in heat. I don't taste the coconut so much as feel it, it adds a lot of richness to the brew and leaves an oily, coconutty film after every sip. Bourbon barrel adds a lot of sweetness which balances everything out.



M: thick, heavy and oily



O: this is one hell of a winter warmer. The typical flavors are complimented and enhanced with the additions. This is an incredibly rich and sweet dessert beer, make no mistake. Startlingly good beer, one of the best I've had in a long whileApr 04, 2021"

Pours a hazy, largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy, slightly off-white foam; good head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, a slim, frothy collar, and myriad spattering of webby/spotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.



Aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront, leaving crackery malt lingering into soft, grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time.



Taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish.



A warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins, an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean Hill IPA profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base.Jun 15, 2022"

This smells like intensely resinous piney hops, grapefruit rind, booze, pineapple, and grapefruit.



This is definitely a bruiser, and easily the booziest HF IPA I've had, which makes a lot of sense. It's quite resinous and bitter, with lots of pine and earthiness. There is a lot of juicy and citrusy type things, too, as I get grapefruit, melon, pineapple, and some lemon. There's not too much malt character, but it does finish a touch boozy.



This is medium bodied, with an intense lingering bitterness, both from the hops and higher alchohol. Despite that, it's still pretty drinkable for me.



I've been waiting to try this one for a long time now. It's not quite the absolute revelation I was hoping for, but I'm still really with it.Feb 03, 2020"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Most recent batch. Thanks, Sam!



A clear light orange with a dense white head with excellent retention and lacing this looks great. The nose is super ripe, fruity, floral apricots with a lactic saison adjacent base. Delicately floral fruit notes, probably from the Pinot Noir casks, is present, though this doesn't have a real red wine character. Vanilla to go with ripe apricots. Awesome. The fruit expression is sublime. 



The palate opens with a blend of lactic tartness, mildly yogurt like with lots of fresh apricots. Just tons of it, though in a nuanced, delicate way rather than the unabashed abandon that's Fou'Foune. No real funk here, this is fruit and acidity in perfect harmony. Vanillin, delicately fruity Pinot Noir, a nice tannin character are all present. Drying, lactic, fruity on the finish with lots of lingering apricots. Tannins and a little grain round out the finish. SARA beers aspire for a higher ideal in the mouthfeel category, and this beer delivers. Light, airy, parfait-like with tons of fine carbonation, just enough to lift the fruit heavy beer but not so much that it's anywhere close to being foamy. Gentle, coaxing, prodding, this is a truly excellent beer.



In contrast to the fresh Fantasia I had a couple of nights back- this has more fruit, more sourness but less funk and less depth outside the fruit. They are both equally good interpretations of the style, and I can see my preference flip flopping.Mar 29, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer poured a golden orange color with high carbonation and a white head. 



Smell - The beer smelled like fresh sweet apricots and light barnyard funk. 



Taste - What strikes me about this beer is how well the apricots and saison funk work together. At the front, the fruit was sweet and fresh before turning funky in the finish. The finish was tart, but not overwhelming. 



Mouthfeel - Carbonation was high, erupting from the newly opened bottle. The dry finish had nice lingering power. 



Overall - What a well-crated saison!Mar 27, 2021"

Roll the bottle around before opening to get a little bit of cloud from the yeast on the bottom, if that's your thing.

Smells like lemon, sour cherries, peachy.

Tastes just like the smell. Dry, smells sweeter than it tastes. Hint of funk.

West Ashley used to taste a lot more tart, but just tastes like sweet nectar now after having it so many times.Jan 18, 2021"

Sante focuses on this funk that their beers offer that I have not tasted in many other breweries that are also known for their ales and saisons, and this was no slacker. A very mellow orange taste is felt at the start but soon the strong peach taste in this one that will blow your mind, the tartness you would expect is minimal if any as the peaches are sweet enough to make your tastebuds focus on that.Jan 15, 2021"

Smell - Citrus came though in the nose with a little bit of sweetness. 



Taste - With a full body, the citra hops needed to be bold. In fact, they were bold. Unlike most citra hopped beers, this one leaned more bitter. It was dank, with notes of guava and lemon. The finish was warm and a bit of spice. 



Mouthfeel - This was not a light beer. It had serious viscosity for the style with notable carbonation. 



Overall - Citra hops went in a bit different direction in this beer. I liked it.Dec 23, 2021"

Pours a foggy, bronze-tinted, rusty orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; good head retention leaves a finger of rich, creamy cap, equally rich collar lining the surface, and thick layers of webby lacing and spotty accessories spread across the entirety of the glass.



Aroma features flaky malts introducing a softer pineapple into mango flesh and a resinous grapefruit interlude sparking a peaking bouquet, whereon transitional pine to fresh-cut grass on the back end remains synchronized to a peppery dank, lemon twist.



Taste opens to pineapple resins with a light tinge of tangerine pith, wrapped in an undertone of freshly sliced mango laden with grassy hop textures; a grapefruit twang over the mid-palate phases effortlessly into a lemony dank finish with flaky malt accents and distant hints of pine.



Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation; a wispy twang invigorates a vague bitterness over the mid-palate, trending sticky as pillowy resins take hold into the back end for a lush hop consistency, and a flaky crispness persists with drying undertones through the finish.



Levels of resinous saturation bridge West Coast and New England IPA elements, bringing into focus advanced tropical fruit development born from an ultra-refined and raw hop core, and a deftly established malt profile; this is a measured intensity, and a deceptively potent variation of the WCIPA.Nov 20, 2021"

Appearance: Slightly cloudy amber-yellow color with a fairly generous generous-sized thick, foamy white head that slowly faded. A nice looking IIPA for my tastes.



Smell: Citrus, tropical fruit aromas and moderate pine aromas. Nothing to fault with the nose.



Taste: Moderately tart grapefruit/citrus notes, moderate tropical fruit notes and mild pine notes. Some mild bready notes from the malts to counter all the hop notes. The beer has a strong hop backbone that provides a fairly dry finish that lets the fruity notes die off gradually.



Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a generous level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is spot on for an IIPA.



Overall: A great IIPA. A very good hop flavor profile with enough of a malt backbone to produce a good flavor profile. i wish I had a time machine so that I could decide if OG Nelson or Citra was/is my favorite IPA/IIPA.Apr 01, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75Canned on 3/22, freshest I've had by some margin!

L: Eschews classic West Coast IPA visual with a slightly more opaque and deeper color than other classics of the style. Beautiful lacing on glass after some sips, yet head dissipates rather quickly. This has little bearing on the beer overall personally, a minor complaint. 

S: Lovely nose of tropical notes. Smells of fruit and citrus, not an overpoweringly strong scent yet clearly expresses the flavor profile to expect. 

T: Citrus and fruit flavor explodes here. Measured bitterness reminds that this is a West Coast IPA, yet has a juiciness that has come to be associated with NEIPAs nowadays. Hoppy and fruity, taste follows suit on the nose and then some. 

F: Perfectly measured medium body, finishes on the dry side yet the tropical fruit and citrus notes linger for some time. 

O: My third experience with Citra, I think I can conclude that this is my favorite West Coast IPA of them all. The juicier and sweeter characteristics of it as opposed to other notable examples of the style put it over the edge as a truly original and exciting beer. Drank fresh, it is an absolute revelation in a time where the IPA market is oversaturated and often difficult to get excited about. Seek it out!Mar 26, 2021"

Holy shit, I’ve finally found a fresh Alchemist drop nearby, and I wasn’t even actively looking. My local store managed to get some of this and Heady Topper. I got a few cans of each (HT is ready for a re-review, and I couldn’t be more psyched on it. Let’s see what this legendary beer is all about



Pours a hazy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing



This is super juicy in the nose, but also shows and incredible balance. I’m picking up on aromas of orange zest, bready malt, mango juice, peppery hops, pithy grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple juice, and light weed



While it’s very good in taste, it doesn’t carry that same balance displayed in the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, orange zest, doughy malt, lemon zest, grassy hops, and light pineapple. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, bready malt, caramel, pineapple juice, grapefruit zest, peppery hops, and light weed



A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with with a nice blend of fruit juice and weed



Well, the taste may have been a bit of a letdown, but overall this is a killer beer. I can’t wait to try more from The AlchemistAug 07, 2022"

Aroma: Blueberries, mango, grapefruit, passionfruit, pine needles, peach, mandarins, raspberries, sweet bready malt, and some Cannabis

Taste: The palate assault begins with pithy citrus, pine sap, and ripe blueberries that immediately expand their breadth and depth. Soon after, Cannabis, tropical fruit, orange-led citrus, and raspberries start to catch up and mix with the initial hop notes and all happening upon a soft, sweet malt base. Slick hop oils and alpha acids come in waves throughout and closes with a bold bite, pine, and dank

Mouthfeel: Full, slick, medium-high carbonation, and medium strength dryness on the finish

Overall: This is a phenomenal beer. Having had this gem and it’s bigger, bolder cousin (Heady) both for the first time in the last week, I can say not only have I been blown away by both, but I would immediately be a convert to the NE-Style/hazy IPA if all of them were like this O.G. Such a great and almost unbelievably deep nose along with tons of flavor depth, some slickness, a bold bite, and dryness are all prominent here and everything I feel many iterations lack more often than not. I now understand the hype of this sub-style where it originated as well as realizing how many times that I’ve heard how good this beer is and now can finally say, I wholeheartedly agreeAug 07, 2022"

Pours three massive fingers of supremely fluffy white head into my Willi glass. Retention is superb, after a few minutes all of the head is still here. Initial lacing looks great. Body is a cloudy yellow, reminiscent of a Witbier. Looks perfect so far.



Nose is soft tropical fruit, mandarin oranges, small dankness. There is a perceived sweetness, likely from the fruit. This smells good, elegant, I hope the fruit isn't too candi-like.



The dankness and fruit balance each other wonderfully on the flavor, with neither being overwhelming. Fruit is mostly soft - mandarin oranges, finishes with a citrus rind bite.



Carbonation is medium-low, a small hop bite adds some character. Body drinks relatively light, which is a welcome characteristic. Bitterness is medium-low. Sweetness mostly comes from the fruit, and isn't cloying. Overall a pretty classic mouthfeel for a classic hazy.



Drinkability is pretty high. It's not cloying, or too bitter.



Appearance turned out wonderful. Lacing was thick all the way down, and a small island of foam remained till the end.



Overall a solid classic. Balanced and flavorful.Jul 18, 2022"

Focal Banger

The Alchemist

New England IPA

ABV: 7%

Date: 05/03/2022

I was given this beer by one of my good friends. I have already consumed a few; they are tasty. Served in a tulip glass at around 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head with above-average retention. The head is bright white, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color is pale straw with hues of light gold, charting beer around SRM 4. This beer is hazy, and little yeasty friends are just floating around. The appearance of the beer is above average. 

Tangerines, lightly floral, with hints of pineapple, pears, and peaches, are the hops aromas. The malt profile is lightly toasted bread crust, cereal grains, and a touch of crackers. Other aromas are grass, wet dew, and yeasty. 

The hop profile is the star of this beer. The hops flavors I taste are tangerine, a hint of pine, a touch of orange peel, pineapple, mango, pears, some floral, and a touch of passionfruit. The malt body is light yet stiff enough to hold the hops in check. Other flavors I detect are lightly toasted bread crust, crackers, a hint of minerals, a touch phenolic, and grassy. 

The mouthfeel is dry and crisp with medium carbonation. The body is medium, and it finishes tannic and long. 

An amazing beer! When I drink NEIPA, this is the standard which I hold other beer. Now I am talking about the balance, flavor profile, and a deft hand in creating this work of art. I wished I lived closer to this brewery, I would have a constant stock of their beer in my fridge.Jul 15, 2022"

Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pint glass (I know what it says on the can, but I like looking at my beer!!!) , this beer features a very pale yellow hazy color with a good size foamy white head and plenty of lacing. Head retention is good. Aroma and taste remind me of Heady Topper in that the aroma cascade out of the can as soon as you open it!!! Lots of grapefruit and pine in the nose and taste. More pronounced ""dankness"" than Heady Topper and I detected kind of a mild tobacco taste that I did not detect in Heady Topper. Mouthfeel is rich, bitter and crisp. A great beer!!!!Jun 26, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.2516 ounce can poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Canned June 30, 2022, so really fresh. I'm excited to try this one.



L---Cloudy, but not impenetrable. Orangey amber color. Medium sized fizzy white head faded slowly and left good lacing.



S---Sweet & fruity. Orange, pineapple, mango. Floral notes.



T---Follows the nose, but not as strong. Floral & fruity flavors abound.



F---Dry & crisp. Kind of red wine like. 



O---An excellent one. If I knew how good it is, I would've bought more than one.Jul 27, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5This is a marvelous DIPA!!!! As good as any I have tried. Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass this beer featured a medium sized bubbly white head that fades pretty quickly and plenty of lacing on the glass. Beautiful, almost clear, orange/light copper color. Aroma and taste are wonderful. Like Heady Topper, the aroma bursts out the second you open the can - mostly floral hops and some tropical fruit. The taste features floral hops as well but there is more piney hops than the nose would indicate. There is some balance with rye or sourdough bready malt but hops rule here. There is a strong and welcome bitterness to this beer - more complex than a simple hop bomb - but bitter enough to satisfy any hophead. Mouthfeel is bitter, crisp and features a richness associated with the malt. Easily one of the best beers I have ever experienced.Jul 10, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours a gorgeous transparent orange with plenty of white head. Tons of lacing after the head recedes. Tiny bubbles throughout the glass that persist. Looks fantastic! 



The nose is incredible. Oranges, apple pie, mango, pineapple, grass, a touch of honey, and a really nice hoppy layer at the end. This is definitely a wonderful tropical fruit nose. Juicy. 



The taste nicely follows the nose. Tropical fruit is definitely there on impact, but nothing like the nose. The middle region and aftertaste are clearly bitter hops. Dank. Citrus peel. Leather, sourdough bread, and a strong earthy note. 



Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Love it.Apr 22, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer, from a double sealed bottle, poured a golden color with an aggressively bubbled white head. 



Smell - The brett character came out in the nose with a degree of bitterness. 



Taste - Grass, green apples, and a brett character that really stands out. The finish had a bitter earthy quality. It was not particularly sour, but it definitely brought the funk. 



Mouthfeel - The carbonation was aggressive, quickly sweeping away any sweetness. 



Overall - No fruits or adjuncts are needed. This was great.Mar 13, 2022"

Really great blend. Tastes like an authentic aged gueuze from one of the Belgian masters.Sep 05, 2021"

4.29/5  rDev -6.3%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25It poured a hazy peach color with a foamy white head. The nose is earthy, musty and very floral with notes of lemon and melon. The taste is surprisingly bitter with heavy notes of grapefruit pith. Minimally sour but still has that lambic funk with a cider quality and mild lactic acidity. The mouthfeel is light bodied with mild acidity. Its actually not harsh on the palate, quite easy to drink. 



Overall: its a great beer. Not as complex as I expected, but its simplicity is not a bad thing. Its quite similar to to FFG Last Four Winters in Wisconsin and New Glarus Vintage series. It would be fun to have them all side by side.Apr 26, 2021"

Acquired via trade

Rank: #86 on Beer Advocate



Appearance: 5 - looks a bit like apple juice. It's as clear as can be with a lovely, fluffy white head.



Nose: 4 - smells just like The Lily. White wine. EXTREMELY funky.



Taste: 4 - weird, it's actually kind of bitter. It's very sout, but it's got this vinegary quality to it. Good, but not amazing. Like a fine gueuze.



Mouth: 5 - bubbles galore. Impressive how it doesn't feel overly carbonated despite the bubbles.



Overall: 4 - tasty, well made, but odd.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Bottle, blend 3, purchased at The Tin Bucket.



A clear copper with a dense, white head with good retention and minimal lacing, this looks solid. The nose is pretty excellent. Insanely funky with preserved lemon, earth, mushroom, petrichor, light honey, floral orange blossoms, grapefruit pith. The dry, dusty, mineraly funk is just awesome. Dried mushroom for days. Delicate elderflower funk notes are present.



The palate opens tart and lactic, a blend of earthy and mushroomy funk, complementing the sourness quite well. The sourness is reserved, not only for the style, but also given the age and the fact that this is an older de Garde. Remarkably well balanced, there are undercurrents of peach and pear. The funk on the palate is just fantastic, with layers of earth, leather, mushroom, cobwebs and must, and yes, some horseblanket as well. Drying, tart on the finish with a moderate carbonation, flavors of earth and mushroom linger. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the funk. Truly old world like.Nov 14, 2020"

Appearance is light yellow, opaque, light head.



Smell is strong grapefruit, citrus, lemon, orange. Maybe just a very slight touch of dank?



Feel is a touch light, but that adds to the drinkability without being too heavy. Nice effervescence.



Taste follows the smell, forward and strong grapefruit dominates, undertones of citrus, lemon, orange. Very delicious, very drinkable. Nicely balanced without being a ‘juice bomb’ or cloyingly dank.



Overall one of (if not the overall) the best hazy NEIPA’s. You could have several of these in a row.Dec 02, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Poured on 5/7/2022 from a 16oz can that was purchased at the brewery on 4/29/2022 into a tulip glass.



A: The beer is a very hazy dark gold color, with a large white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.



S: The aroma contains strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits, floral and dank hops and light caramelized malts.



T: The taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong but not over-powering floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.



M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.



O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent 2NEIPA to drink for a very long time.May 08, 2022"

This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego, which is one of their only flagship NEIPAs that I have not tried yet, so I can't draw any comparisons there. However, I have had Doubleganger, the extra hopped variant of this and enjoyed it quite a bit



Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing



There is a perfect blend of tropical fruit and dank herbal hops in the nose, quite unlike any beer of theirs or any IPA really, almost an earthy perfume vibe that oddly reminds me of the smell of a church. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, creamy peach, juicy papaya, pithy grapefruit, grassy hops, dank herbs, a bit of onion, and doughy malt to hold it all together



Herbaceous vibes from the nose translate well into taste but with less intensity, allowing for greater balance which bumps up my rating. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy papaya, mango, overripe grapefruit, light pine, and a creamy malt. The swallow brings notes of herbal hops, creamy malt, tangerine, and underripe cantaloupe



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a very creamy beer that coats the mouth on the way down. Finishes somewhere between dry and slick



This one was interesting for sure. Way more herbs than I usually get in a TH beer, and for uniqueness alone I have to bump up the overall score. Really good stuff here!Mar 02, 2021"

$17.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22



Notes via stream of consciousness: A two finger thick head of off-white rests atop a murky golden body with an orange sheen. The aroma isn't as strong as I expected but it delivers some orange and passionfruit over a sweetish and grainy malt base. The flavor is bright and vibrant with a clear note of tangerine backed by passionfruit, nectarine, apricot, and mango. The malt is delicately sweetish, bready, and lightly oat-like. The bitterness is moderate and yet it finishes dry due at least in part to some hop acidity. In the mouth it's medium bodied but it feels a little fuller due to all of the extra proteins giving it a fluffy feel. It's smooth but that hop burn gives it a little bit of an edge. The head has held up really well and I've still got a creamy, but more importanty complete, surface covering. The lacing covers quite a bit and looks like a drawing of trees out of a book of scary stories. The aroma is better on their ""Very Hazy"", and I've scored it better overall, but for my money I prefer this easier drinking version.

3.59/5  rDev -21.4%
look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.5Lovely golden orange body; cloudy; thick head, white and sculpted and long lasting. An interesting aroma; like a sage / cucumber mix; faint bit of citrus. The taste follows along the lines of the smell; stronger sense of cucumber rind bitterness; biscuit-like malt flavor. Heavy body; moderate acidity; somewhat juicy, somewhat dry on the palate.



All I can say is the smell and taste are weird. I don't recall tasting anything like this. If there is supposed to be a stronger citrus presence, it's missing in this sample. If anything, the hop profile seems like some weird combination of Motueka and Nelson Savin hops. Motueka has never thrilled me, but Nelson Savin can be very interesting. Still, there must be a reason it (currently) has a 100 score on BA, but I certainly don't understand it.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Impressive dome head which never recedes completely. Excellent lacing with a variety of streaks and spots. The liquid is cloudy with a dirty gold appearance.



Grapefruit rind aroma along with some green vegetal/fresh cut grass notes. The malt is hard to tease out, but I would say it's closest to light wheat bread.



There's a berry sweetness up front. Richer body with a neutral level of carbonation. The hop is pronounced but not overwhelming. It's closer to black pepper with a notable alcohol warmth in the swallow. The sweetness returns in the aftertaste, but dissipates first leaving the peppery finish.Feb 11, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25So maybe I made mistake of having very hazy first, but this one, while good, is so much like hundreds of other neipa's I have had. Murky darker yellow hazy body with a huge white head, spotted lacing. Big grapefruit and citrus with light pineapple lead the nose. Taste is much the same, some tangerine additions are nice. Body is medium-light with decent brightness and smoothness, not the most lush neipa ever. Does hide the abv very wellJan 06, 2022"

$15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22



Notes via stream of consciousness: A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden/brass colored body. The head appears to be holding quite well. The aroma is fairly mild for an NEIPA but offers up passionfruit, nectarine, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of orange, pineapple, juicy apple, and distant lemon/lime. The malt is basic, most likely with 2-row, wheat, and oats although I can't specifically taste the wheat or oats. A solid bitterness backs it and it finishes dry with some quickly passing fruit that leaves a soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue. It's fluffy and smooth with plenty of proteins. The head held up really well and it's left some very interesting to look at lace all around the glass. All in all I don't think that Green is Treehouse's best beer by any stretch but it's a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

If you like New England style India pale ales and sharp, spiky bitterness, this is the beer for you.

Look: Pours a hazy yellowish orange with a foamy white head leaving a good amount of lacing. No floaters.



Smell: Fresh citrus fruits. Mainly orange and tangerine. Hints of mango and pineapple.



Taste: Also orange, tangerine, mango and pineapple. White grapes and lime are there, too. Low sweetness, medium bitterness. 



Feel: Smooth and juicy. Very dry finish.



Overall: With Very Green and Very Gggreennn being two of my absolute favorites from Tree House, I was a bit disappointed by this one. No question it's a great beer, but I was just expecting more of the complexity of its siblings. However, it's a fresh and crushable beer and drinks very smoothly.Mar 07, 2022"

Bought at brewery.

Canned 8 days prior to review.

Quite frothy, quickly dissipating, white head. Fairly murky, medium orange with some amber overtones, to the look. Mango, guava, candied tangelo peel, a little medium roast caramel malt, emerges out of the mix. Seems like there is a whiff of some nutmeg/allspice, or such, buried deep in the aroma. A nice melange of some Mandarin orange peel, a bit of medium light toasted malt, underlying, and a whiff of guava/passion fruit, deep in the taste somewhere. There is some lightness to this beer and it finishes mainly with a little tingly, glowing, Mandarin orange/tangelo peel bite. Definitely well done.Nov 13, 2021"

Smell - The typical nose of orange/tangerines was present.



Taste - The profile was loaded with green spicy hops. The citrus notes brought oranges to mind with just a bit of spice. I did not get pineapple as others did, though I searched hard. A overall gritty nature was noted. 



Mouthfeel - Viscosity allowed the profile to link with peppery notes clinging tightest. 



Overall - Once you have had a Tree House IPA, you will always recognize one.Oct 18, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Viscous almost gloppy black out of the bottle, it forms a thin dark tan film that quickly settles to a thin chain.



Significant barrel spice and heat are right up front before the thick body envelopes the palate with maple, coconut, and mocha brownies. The finish actually cleans up and even becomes somewhat crisp to a semi-dry, tingly and only slightly sticky lip smacking swallow.



The barrel is significant here. Mature, spicy, peppery, and lightly charred with a caramel and even spiced rum character to it. This compliments the maple well, while tempering the decadence of the mocha, vanilla and coconut, which is like a swirling creme anglaise throughout.Jul 30, 2019"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 3.752018 Vintage



750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want!



Pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75



Nose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25



Palate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0



Mouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25



Overall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.  3.75Jul 09, 2021"

look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 | overall: 3.75Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time.May 09, 2021"

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Abyss black body; fizzy carbonation percolating up through the depths; initial decent head yet it quickly dissipates to a thin fizzy ring dancing around the circumference of the glass. Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality.



2020 edition, unknown ABV (the 2021 version is 11.8% ABV). This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department. This is one awesome imperial stout augmented with a devilish chili pepper kick.Apr 18, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.52020 release. Received from @roguer. Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. It pours almost jet black with a creamy, medium mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly. Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon. All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors. It's so easy to drink. The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% . Overall, Hunahpu's is everything I thought it would be - and more. It's delicious and perfect either to pair with a hearty meal or for casual drinking. I'm grateful to finally drink this white whale.Apr 11, 2021"

A: slight oak and cocoa overpowered by cinnamon and a spiciness



T: Fudgy up front followed by a perfect spicy chocolateness and really a great mole character which I what I think is their goal. Almost taste like a cinnamon graham cracker in the beginning. 



M: Slightly thin for a beer of this stature, but the medium body is welcome with the spice complexity. 



O: Finally glad I got to enjoy this one I’ve been seeking for years. It’s a well crafted beer and one of the best spiced beers I’ve had.Jan 25, 2021"

3.55/5  rDev -22.3%
look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 | overall: 4Appearance – This ale is a light clear orange in color with a good white head that left a lot of lacing.



Smell – The ale is hop-forward and delicately balanced. The grapefruit is mild and the pineapple barely noticeable. It smells very smooth and even.



Taste – The tangy grapefruit is a little stronger here but tempered by a mild sweetness. Not getting a lot of malt though.



Mouthfeel – Light-bodied, just a tad bigger than a light lager, with a small dryness at the finish.



Drinkability – I didn’t think anything stood out with this APA but everything works very well together.Oct 03, 2022"

Poured an opaque golden amber color into a pint glass with a off white 2 fingers pillowey high head that lasted; dainty carbonation with lots of lacing. Aroma is hop forward with earth and malt overtone that also offer some floral notes. Taste is bitter throughout with a slightly citrusy bitter sweet finish that lingers. Mouth is chewy and flavorful, very satisfying. A little dark and hoppy for a pale ale, but oh sooo good! In fact it was so good I had to go back to where I got it and buy the remaining 2 six packs.

The aroma starts with a sweetness that reminds me of papaya and guava (in a word, tropical). The hop is mostly floral with a bit of black pepper thrown in. 



The malt is dryer than I expected, certainly less tropical than the smell. The hop is more pronounced producing a bitter bite. The body is neutral as is the carbonation. Long bitter aftertaste.Aug 20, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Acquired in a trade with @Turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in June 2022.



Look: Pours a burnished, bright orange, with a white, persistent head. Leaves lacing on the glass as it goes down.



Nose: Oh yeah! Big, bitter hops, clean orange citrus, caramel malt. This is a throwback to the good old days!



Taste: Even better than the nose! It has a big bitter hop burn that's awesomely bracing. Flavour wise there's a dank resinous note that gives way to clean orange and pineapple citrus. The finish is uber clean.



Mouth: It's like chewing a beer - you know it's in your mouth and it doesn't disappoint. There's high carbonation that leaves a lot of carbonic prickling on the tongue and in the throat, and on the swallow there's a warning kick, presumably from the hops. Awesome.



Overall: This is a fantastic throwback to an old-school, big, bitter, citrusy pale ale. Great beer!

Nothing different from what I’d expect from a regular IPA. Feels and tastes of a heavy malt with a smooth finish. The smoothness clearly gives it the edge, but outside of that not a 100 rated beer.

4.77/5  rDev +4.1%
look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Lightly foggy burnt orange to amber, nearly glowing, with a tall off-white foam head settling to unevenly airy, bubbly lumps that are somewhat translucent, translating more to a khaki hue, leaving tiny spots of lace on the glass.



Smell is both more oaky and peppery than regularly OG, a little dusty even, but also brighter and spicier, in a pleasant, sense-awakening way. Adding to the allure are hints of dried, gooey apricot, fresh fig and white grape.



The medium body's lively effervescence perks up the palate, again with surprisingly bright, zippy characteristics. It's super refreshing and also very pleasantly balanced on the palate, quaffable to a frightening degree, particularly for a bottle so hard to find.



It's like a mimosa with white grape juice instead of orange, while very fine white oak adds complementary complexity without any undesirable features, and barely a touch of funk. Again here it's more peppery, yet not as toasty as regular OG, but it simultaneously gives a feel like you can crunch down on it before the frothy light carbonation dies into a perfectly clean, semi-dry swallow. It consistently reminds me of nelson, my favorite hop.



Absolutely scrumptious, with an unbelievable mouthfeel.Oct 26, 2020"

Pours a clean straw. Nose of white wine, somewhat jammy (cherry, strawberry?), Funk and barnyard, and honey as it warms. Taste of funk, jammy characteristics, vinous. Feel is light with medium carb. Overall, wow! What an excellent wild and held up very well.May 21, 2021"

4.4/5  rDev -4.1%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer was the color of an apricot. It was golden orange with some red hues. Carbonation was visible. 



Smell - The apricot seemed dry in the nose, but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison. 



Taste - At the front, the apricots were quite sour. It really tingled the sides of the tongue. There was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness. Toward the back, the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance.



Mouthfeel - The body was vicious, almost like an actual fruit smoothie.



Overall - I can definitely appreciate a saison like this.Aug 08, 2022"

4.55/5  rDev -0.9%
look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours an apricot orange with a little haze to the translucency. Transparency drops towards murky when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. Head never forms. Aroma is apricot right off the cuff, although it's mild and nuanced into the profile. Stone, lemongrass, and earth add some more depth. It has a pleasant tartness to it, leaning into a little acidity. Flavor profile takes the acidity up a notch, especially when served at fridge temperature. The acidity wanes as the beer warms. Apricot adds some sweetness, and is more forward than the nose, taking up a more dominate role. It's still well balanced and nuanced into the flavor profile. Cellar stone, earthy malts, grass, and lemon zest create the rest of the profile, all accompanied by some minor tartness. Mouth feel is still in effervescence, delivering a smooth texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a tart apricot saison that delivers tasty simplicity.

Look: dark red with an inch thick off-white head



Aroma: raspberry, white wine. 



Taste: The flavor is tart raspberry, lots of raspberry, lemon, oak, white wine, and there's a very long and pleasant tart and dry raspberry after taste.



Body/Overall: medium bodyNov 10, 2019"

Flavor with notes of lemon sourness, raspberries, white wine, mild sulfur, lactic acid and oak. Dry aftertaste with practically no residual sugar.

Light body with mild carbonation. It is not flat as in Lambic.

This is how a Fruit Lambic should be. No sugar residues with the raspberries fruitiness that is an extension of the natural Lambic flavors.Oct 08, 2019"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Vibrant ruby with a soft head settling to a persistent creamy white film and thick collar.



Taste is full of seedy raspberry with a mild, balanced acidity that's woodier and a little funkier than Gambrinus. The soft fluffy body comes across as a bit more delicate than Gambrinus, and a little less sour. The semi-dry finish brings up notes of toasty cracker and a little char, but overall LPF is really expressive of fruit without the added acid that often comes along with it.Oct 07, 2019"

It is very cloudy but it is not murky, it looks so in the picture but the edges have a slight clarity to them. Perfectly white creamy looking head, some generous lacing with almost every sip. 



The smell is so so lively, like bursting out of the glass. Super pungent peach, citrus, also hints of tropical fruits. 



The taste follows the nose mainly in the same peachy citrus I first got from the nose. There’s also a nice grassiness that I didn’t pick up on in the nose along with the slightest touch of herbal green flowers. 



This beer has a medium body but it is such a soft and pleasant beer to drink. Semi dry finish with a medium bitterness that goes down so smooth and clean.Jul 04, 2021"

That’s ok tho because the beer has a great pineapple grapefruit oniony nose. 

Flavor is bitter on the front and nice grapefruit and pineapple on the back. 

Really delicious. I like the bitterness. Something a lot of northeast IPAs don’t have. 

Really good pale overall.Dec 18, 2021"

Cloudy, medium orange, with some yellow/gold highlights, for the look. Very fruity, tangelo peel and some grapefruit peel, in the aroma. Rather thin bodied & tasting. The flavors are mainly, mixed citrus peel, with just barely enough, medium light, toasted malt, to give it any body whatsoever. So-so.Nov 12, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Super hazy/cloudy yellow/orange like pineapple juice with a touch of orange. The head is substantial, retains well and manages some nice lace. 

The aroma is grapefruit, pineapple and pine resin with a hint of light caramel malt in the background. The taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of Cara Cara oranges, lemon, apricot, mango and passion fruit, slightly sweet with a light malt background, balanced by plenty of grapefruit pulp and pine resin bitterness. The finish is dry with lingering pine resin and a white pepper note. 

The body is full with moderate carbonation, smooth but with a fell of light pulp content even if not visible. 

Altogether this is an amazingly tasty and enjoyable brew, everything is balanced for maximum impact that makes the ABV almost unnoticed..Jun 03, 2022"

But over the past few months theyve all been hit or miss. And for $20 a 4 pack it hurts when you miss. Then i came back to an old favorite--Toppling Golliath. its got just about everything i like about all these beers, everything i hope for every time i by the new weekly. BUT HERES THE THING. King Sue has ""it"" every time. Real big fresh hoppy tones (citra) but so fresh, like they use real hops vs canned or dried hops if i had to guess. The pale ale version pseudo sue is just as good.May 10, 2022"

Pours a hazy, golden color. A one finger, white head on the initial pour that fades to a sticky residue on the glass.



Wonderful fruity, lemony aroma.



A citrusy, reiseny, slightly bitter taste. Slightly sweet. Very good IPA.



Medium consistency, medium carbonation.



My first brew from Toppling Goliath and I was impressed. I would definitely seek this out in the future. Cheers!May 08, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Original bottling



It is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"".



Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.



All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better.



Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.



Another masterpiece from the master I regret not tasting fresh. It has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshmentDec 12, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Alan, I cannot thank you enough for this bottle. 



375ml bottle - 2018 vintage - poured into a wide tulip at 44°F. 



Pours a clear, yet ever-so-slightly foggy true gold hue, with all but a loose ring of white foam forming, that sticks around permanently. Some lazy effervescence is visible. 



Nose: In classic Hill Farmstead form, the aroma is beautifully delicate and fragile, beginning with subtle notes of malt and wheat, with a rustic sort of grainy note about it. Atop this, gentle acidity and beautiful minerality act as a conduit for a melange of bright vinous fruits in the form of lemon, pear, apple, nectarine, white grape, and gooseberry, and then this subtle, yet spectacular dark fruit note that is quietly jammy, sweet, and plummet, almost evoking a hint of grape juice and grape pixie stix. Finally, threads of oak, hay, grass, attic, leather, parchment, wet moss, and petrichor stitch it a together. Absolutely spectacular. 



Palate: Immediately, the defining notes of the base beer - Florence, are beautifully showcased here, rounded by maturity. She greets the palate with the most restrained acidity with a hint of lemon-lime, and then that unique floral, fresh coriander-eucalyptus note peaks through. Bright fresh fruity notes of pear, gooseberry, white wine grape, underripe plum, and tart plum skins all play together, surrounded by a racey, vibrant minerality that sparkles over the palate. There is a subtle thread of funk, lending damp earth, moss, hay, wet oak, white grape pomace, river stones, and a whisper if dusty brett, before the lemon-lime and exotic fruity floral notes resurface. A slight minty/camphoraceous element cools the palate, and then the oak comes in to dry out the fruity bits. Flora Plum finishes dry and clean, with a faint hint of grain, and zero acidity. 



Mouthfeel/Body: Delicate, light, and crisp, yet managing to avoid being watery or lacking in any way. Perfect gentle acidity, which is complimented by a zippy, sparkling minerality, and lively, but delicate effervescence. Perfectly dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness and plum-skin tartness. Subtle drying oak, and as clean as you could imagine. 



Overall: This is a truly spectacular farmhouse ale. I thought blueberry was divine, yet I believe this exceeds it - and I'm a sucker for blueberry. It's just so delicate, elegant, and tasteful, while truly conveying all the character of Florence, softened by oak and time, and delivering this subtle, but beautiful fruity plum influence. There's a reason this beer is so highly revered. Practically flawless, and utterly Hill Farmstead.Oct 05, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Displaying a unique color of lightly foggy pale orange or even crayon peach, a moderately dense white blanket settles down to a curled, quietly active ring.



The nose has faint, mildly dusty oak pairing with a pleasantly subtle floral perfume that's just hypnotizing.



Uniquely and cleanly juicy, a lightly herbal, drupe-influenced sort of pear character with just a kiss of tartness is dreamily weaved throughout the zippy effervescence of its satisfyingly palate massaging medium-light body before coming to a vanishing semi-dry swallow.



Flora Plum is such a perfectly quaffable yet delicately complex brew, it's beyond words. I love being floored by subtly delicate complexity like this. The experience is pure, even without a discernible Hill expression. It seems to even transcend that already high bar.Apr 21, 2020"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Can dated 9/15/20. Poured into Trillium tulip shaped glass. Looks like dirty orange juice. Great smell of hops, but not so much as other Trillium DDH varieties I’ve had. Taste is really well balanced — not overpowering with citrus — with a long, ever-so-slightly bitter, lingering finish. Doesn’t stand out in any singular, exaggerated way, but a very nicely balanced IPA. Nicely done.Sep 27, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5L: Super Hazy yellow with a tint of orange and a bubbly head that dissipates leaving modest lacing.



S: Bright and resinous tropical fruits. Mango, peach, and pineapple. The malt showcases itself surprisingly well with some candied bread.



T: Firm bitterness, moves into a huge hop flavor of mango, peach, and pine resin. The malt provides a decent backbone with some candied crystal malt presence.



F: Dry, but somewhat creamy from a generous dose of wheat or oats.



Overall: A stellar NEIPA, insanely hoppy. You must try this beer if you are a hophead.Sep 19, 2020"

Nose (4): not sure why, but not very strong from what i can tell. Smells citrusy and bitter/a little dank

Feel (4.75): Medium/full body. this is really nice and soft/pillow and creamy up front and nice and dryer at the end. Light/moderate carbonation

Taste (4.75): Citrusy, but can't tell exactly what ""candied"" fruit. More bitterness and hops. Bit of dankness. More dankness than typical NEIPA

Overall (4.75) Really great beer. One of the top ones that I've had. Great body, flavor, hops, right complexity, and very smoothJun 17, 2020"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75On tap at Armsby Abby.



L -- Golden orange with the usual HF fluffy, sticky, white head 

S -- What a lovely showcase of Galaxy. Not too sweaty/oniony, just tons of tropical fruit, creamy citrus flesh, and sweet floral. Doesn't pop out of the glass like Trillium's galaxy-forward offerings

T -- While the pineapple and orange sherbert notes of Galaxy are definitely there, there's also a decent amount of this interesting nelson-like white grape character, and also a hint of mosaic-lile cattiness. Oat forward malt bill makes for a neutral sweetness

F -- I love the Hill Farmstead mineralic mouthfeel, both tannic and soft. Fluffy 

O -- Favorite of the single hopped Hill Farmstead DIPAs

M - Big medium body with a soft, smooth texture

Great representation of Galaxy hops. 

Nice white head. Sticks around. 

Smells like candied pineapple and bubble gum. 

Taste has the pineapple on the front but a nice bitter backbone.

Canned 8 days prior to review.

Medium thick, frothy white head, that quickly thins out. Vivid, cloudy, medium orange color, with much intricate lacing to start off with. The aroma has a candied malt, guava, pineapple, a little mixed sweet spice underneath. Flavors of candied tangerine peel, guava, passion fruit, with a bit of help from some medium toast malt, in the background, to fill out the body and some of the flavors. There is a bright effervescence to it, as well. The finish is largely a mixed citrus peel glow, then a moderate bite.Nov 17, 2021"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. This is a really good-looking NEIPA - juicy, milkshake-like burnt yellow with a near-1-finger white head on top. 



S: Nose does NOT disappoint - it jumps out of the glass with a bushel of fruit: pineapple, melon, ripe apricot/peach, a touch of lime. 



T: Pretty much follows the nose, with pineapple, ripe melon, mango, tangerine, orange creamsicle, then finishing with a lemon-lime bitterness and key lime pie. The 8% ABV is not noted at all, though I think I'm getting a little warmth in the belly. 



M: Medium to full-bodied, creamy feel to this one - more creamy than juicy, if that makes sense. Real nice feel to it, challenges Tree House's best in that regard.



O: Phenomenal. A really, really good NEIPA.Aug 18, 2020"

Pours a pale pastel yellow with a coarse 0.5 finger white head. Nose is citrus, pear, and apple. All underripe. Actually a bit more muted than I thought it would be. Some cane sugar and starfruit in there as well. Beer opens grapefruit, pear, and apple. An interesting take on the tropical fruit flavor profile. The middle yields notes of citrus, a touch of grassiness, and more pear skin. End is more pear, apple, and citrus fruit. Finish bone dry with an aftertaste of citrus rind. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Prickly and foamy in the mouth and aggressive going down. Probably the dryest beer I've had to date. A long, lingering aftertaste. 



Good, not great. That body is something to experience though.Apr 28, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Pours black with a still look. It has oily legs as you swirl the glass. Aroma is coconut water and soy sauce. Toasted coconut, chocolate, caramel, and roasty and toasty malts all come thru, leaning lightly towards 'sweet'. Flavor profile is the same, big coconut water mixed in with hearty toasty and roasty malts. Chocolate comes on at the finish. Soy sauce permeates the middle, distracting a touch from the rest of the profile. Mouth feel is thick, creamy, and decadent. Overall, big and bold, with a clear and intentional focus on coconut, as the label would suggest. It's a soothing pillow of coconut.

4.84/5  rDev +5.2%
look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75This review is based on a 2020 label date opened in 2022, stored under dark refrigeration. This beer ages well, no doubt. 



Look: Very dark, and is about as translucent as used Diesel motor oil, which is to say it is quite opaque. It is a very dark brown in color, with a medium brown head. 



Smell and taste: Bourbon (of course), chocolate, tobacco, some dried hay, some smoke but not a lot. and more and more roasted loveliness. The alcohol burn is there, but it really just transports all of the flavors to the nose and tongue and is not overly intrusive. Everything is balanced, which is a characteristic of all of my favorite beers. Take a sip, and contemplate all of the different flavors as they dance across your tongue from start to finish, front to back. There is a lot of variety here. 



Feel: As at least one other review mentions, for its massive burst of robust, intense flavor, it is not a thick beer, but is surprisingly thin. It is not a make-or-break for the beer, just an interesting characteristic. ""



Overall: One of my top 10 beers (The old bomber Karbach BBHs, La Fin Du Monde, Avery Reverend, Aventinus, Real Ale Sisyphus, Avery Maharaja, Ranger Creek Wee Heavy, any dark ale from Double Mountain in Oregon, New Belgium Ranger Imperial IPA)



I always drink these out of a Bordeaux style wine glass since it concentrates the scent of the beer. I usually pour one right out of the fridge and drink it slowly over an hour or so, savoring the considerable shifts in flavor as it warms up. The coffee and the chocolate notes become more predominant, and the complexity bursts forth. The finish also becomes more Aventinus like and will linger on the tongue as long as you want it to. There is a strange stage about 20 minutes in when a burnt nut bitterness becomes more apparent amongst all of the other flavors. But, fret not, just wait and it will revert back to its full palate. 



I don't love my favorite beers because they score high on this site. I love them because they are fantastic. This is a fantastic beer.Aug 20, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5A: when pored the appearance is as black as can be. This beer is so dark, the foam appears to be a dark brown rather than the the typical white. This appearance is how you know this will be a serious stout.



S: There are definitely notes of bourbon in the aroma. You can also detect notes of roasted barley and oak.



T: The taste of this brew is suburb for an imperial stout. There is a rich blend of flavors from the oak, the bourbon and the malts. While there is also some hop presence, its really the bourbon that takes center stage here. This is definitely the gold standard for a barreled aged beer. 



M: The mouth feel is very warming. That is to be expected at with a beer with a big abv like this one. This is definitely something you want to drink in the colder weather,



O: Overall Goose island nailed this style. I don't often give 5 star ratings but this brew earned it. It is such a rich imperial stout that drinks very smoothly. It is one of the best beers I have ever drank. Final rating 5/5.Aug 11, 2022"

Live review. Poured from the 1 pint, 0.9 ounce bottle that I found at a cool bottle shop in Mentor, Ohio about 18 months ago for, if I recall correctly, about $15. 2019 indicated on the neck label. Drink by: 25 AUG 24 08:33 14.7% ALC/VOL printed on the lower part of the label on the body of the bottle.

A: The look does not disappoint. The darkest body with a brief dark brown head which lasts about 10 seconds and I poured generously into a clean, clear snifter. Love this look, even if much of it is to style. 4.5

S: Dark fruits predominate without too much “heat” of alcohol which I expected somewhat due to the high ABV. I certainly pick up some deep, sweet bourbon notes but the dark fruits are front and center. Intriguing and I give it “extra credit” for not being too “hot.” 4.5

T: Wow. So much going on here. Early taste is a LOT of dark fruits, heat of alcohol bourbon notes dancing on my tongue and then dissipating into a long, slow, alcohol slide out to an amazing finish of smooth dark roast malt but that process takes about 2 minutes. 4.5

M: Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and the beer’s reputation. Mind you, this is NOT a thin beer, just that I had expected one of the fullest, thickest beers but it is not. 3.5

D: Drinkability/Overall: Overall a fantastic beer, one that everyone reading this should seek out. Drinkability is limited by your budget and your sobriety but this is a “night capper” kind of beer. Only a fool would drink several of these in one evening. Intention, in my opinion, is to enjoy one of these in an evening, and frankly share it with someone else. 4.0Aug 07, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 5Very first time that I've ever had something like this. The bottle I have is from the 2019 stock.



Poured into a chalice-like glass. Color is a very dark blackish and brown mix. Thick and syrup-like with a noticeable alcohol aroma.



Smell is excellent and to me consists of chocolate, plum, coffee, caramel, vanilla, and of course, Bourbon. 



The 14.7 ABV brings a nice, warm taste to the experience and I look forward to my next bottle.



Oh yeah, enjoy it with your friends or the family members and they will thank you for the chance to taste a great stout. I highly recommend this to everyone.Jun 25, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5Not much of a head. Very rich on the nose; bourbon, figs, cola, milk chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is heavy on the bourbon, with figs, honey, and chocolate, followed by roasted malt and coffee. Hints of vanilla and oak come and go. The bourbon really dominates, more than just about any other BA stout I’ve had. Feel is a bit oily, and the alcohol warmth approaches that of a wine. 

I understand why it’s a classic. This beer has some kick, but does so without becoming cloying or unbalanced. Not my favorite, but great nonetheless.May 07, 2022"

L: Dark! Dark and thick as motor oil. Even the short head is caramel in color. It is beautiful! 

S: Nice aroma akin to the bourbon barrels in which it was aged. The mixture of malty stout and bourbon is heavenly. 

T: This isn't an overly complex stout, and it delivers very well on what it promises. Malt, bourbon, and stout. This isn't too say that nothing else is going on. There are underlying flavors that play well together, and the concert of all the flavors together are well-balanced.

F: Thick and smooth! Matches the look beautifully.

O: I love this beer. I scored it shy of perfect because I want there to be even more of everything I described. But maybe leaving me wanting more is what makes this beer so amazing.Apr 15, 2022"

S - Sweet up front. Vanilla. Cola and chocolate. Alcohol. Dark fruit. Raisin or cherry. Some bread scents in the back.



T - Sweet taste as follows scent. Lots of dark fruit (prune, date, raisin) up front. Almost the taste of a port wine. Caramel and vanilla in there. A slight wood or oak. Chocolate notes as well. Love the complexity of each taste providing a little bit different each time. Not boozy even after is warms up some further along like other high ABV beers.



F - Really good medium body mouthfeel. Lower carbonation from and aged Beer. Very smooth and drinkable at high ABV

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5This is my first review on BeerAdvocate!



Pouring this from a 16.9 oz bottle, the pour produces a nice finger or so of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes. A bit of lace is left around the edge, with light head left bubbling in the middle. Overall a very dark, nearly black pour gives off a strong boozy scent not uncommon in barrel-aged stouts. The aroma is also quite sweet, which for me is always a good sign of a stout with a good body and careful construction. So far, so good.



The first taste is very, very heavy on the tongue. This is an Imperial Stout with a lot going on. It sticks to the inside of your mouth like a stout should and has a sweet-hot initial hit, likely thanks to the very high ABV of 14%. There is a certain candy flavor up front that I am not a huge fan of, but it doesn't stay around for long. Afterward the taste dissolves into almost a cola-like flavor that lingers for a long time. It feels like there are a ton of flavors, including coffee and dried fruit that almost overwhelm anything else. 



This is a fine beer. It isn't my favorite stout of all time, but it is an American Imperial Stout, and is amongst the most well-crafted I have ever had. I can see this being someone's go-too Stout when it's in season, but the flavor profile is just a little too sweet for me. 



Still, very good.Feb 05, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Poured from bottle into snifter after about a day in the 50 degree wine cooler. 

Look: deep brown, nearly black, with a light coffee colored head. Delightful

Smell: IMO this is the best part of the KBS. Comes off almost like a Mexican hot chocolate with deep chocolate notes, some small cinnamon hints. Booziness apparent from the scent.

Taste: Matches the smell nearly to a T. Heavy alcohol heat throughout with the chocolate notes brightening as it leaves your mouth. Just like a barrel stout should be. Quite sweet, but even as someone who doesn’t love sweet beers, it’s great.

Feel: Carbonation is quite low, so the combination of the stout density and boozy heat creates a rather unique, slick feel in the mouth. High sugar content seems to be enhanced by the slick feel.

Overall: King of barrel aged stouts for me. Great stuffApr 24, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Preface by saying I’m not the biggest stout fan.



Bottled 12/4/2021 poured straight from the fridge into a frosted glass. Started around 48° and it was very closed up. Still able to get all the main notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon, but they were nowhere near as strong until the beer warmed up. My favorite temp was about 55-60° but I sipped until it hit closer to 70°



Overall: Incredible stout. Loads of separate flavors that all come together perfectly! 



L: pitch black color, can’t even see light coming through when held up to a lamp. Toasted brown head with good retention and lacing from top to bottom. 



S: at first I got more chocolate than anything else, but as the beer warmed up 5-10° I got a much darker chocolate and strong coffee notes followed by bourbon on the end. Chocolate heavy overall 



T:cold straight from the fridge at 48° I got some coffee and chocolate and maybe some black licorice with a heavy hit of alcohol at the end. As the beer warmed up the alcohol completely disappeared. Strong coffee flavor followed by dark chocolate and some nice bitterness that you would get from a nice piece of dark chocolate. Bourbon follows on the aftertaste. Slightly sweet at first with a bitter ending. Some roasted malt, but coffee and chocolate are by far the strongest notes. 



F: low carbonation, thicker and slightly creamy without being overly heavy. Very smoothMar 18, 2022"

5/5  rDev +8.7%
look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Look: Poured from a 12 oz into a glass - Midnight black pour just like a stout. lightly thin/ brown foam risen to the surface. Quickly dissolves over time. A bit of lacing on the sides like some of these bubbles don't want to give up.

Smell: Getting the heavy notes of sweet bourbon barrels - getting some chocolatey vanilla aromas to it. Not much on the coffee side this pour.

Taste: Definitely tasting the heavy chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The initial taste is coffee, followed by the taste of coffee, finishing with the bourbon after taste. Very nice!!!!

Feel: Getting light carbonation - very smooth. Very well hides the alcohol.

Overall: This bad boy proves to live up to it's standards. Wasn't sure because barrel aged stouts aren't my route but this proved me differently. Will buy again and if you haven't tried it. This is a must try beer!Feb 15, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.512 ounce bottle poured into a snulip glass. Bottled on 9/9/21.



L---Darkest brown color. Fairly thin light brown head faded quickly to a ring and left ok lacing. Head doesn't sound like much, but I think it's actually pretty good for the high ABV.



S---Strong chocolate, lighter vanilla and bourbon barrel. Not as much coffee as I was expecting.



T---Wow, very flavorful and nuanced. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon and vanilla are all distinct. ABV is well hidden behind sweetness. 



F---Medium/full bodied with minimal carbonation. Almost a creamy texture with no alcohol burn.



O---I have been looking forward to trying this one and I was not disappointed. The best offering from an excellent brewery.Jan 29, 2022"

3.72/5  rDev -19.1%
look: 4 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 4I recently tried and reviewed Founders - Breakfast Stout, which is also highly regarded. Similar to that review, I will state that I actively dislike coffee. Both the taste and the smell. So I don't foresee me falling in love with this beer, but I did want to try it out to see what all the fuss was about.



L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at roughly 55 degrees. The beer pours a dark black opaque. Very thin film of tan head which quickly faded to bubbles. The thin head only leaves moderate lacing.



S - The roasted coffee comes up front with a slight hint of chocolate. Not much else. It's pretty much straight-up coffee smell.



T - The coffee roast comes up front, then fades to a chocolate. There’s a little bit of cola flavor there too. The flavor is then balanced with a slight bourbon at the end. Aftertaste is a mild coffee roast. Toward the end of the beer though, the coffee notes fade a little and the chocolate notes take center stage. The taste is much more complex and pleasing than the smell.



F - The carbonation is almost like a cola. Smooth texture overall. Easy to drink. 



O - Again, I tried this a week after trying Founders Oatmeal Stout. From memory, they are very similar. (Not sure about side-by-side comparison.) As I stated in that previous review, I do not like coffee. Taste or smell. But these were so highly regarded that I had to try them. I still don’t prefer the coffee taste, but this is still a great beer. Very smooth flavors that go together well. The 12% alcohol did not make this boozy at all. It was all flavor and no sign of high alcohol. I personally won’t try this again, but for a coffee drinker, this would be a fantastic beer.



Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future.Jan 27, 2022"

Appearance: 4 - a lovely bright orange. Head fizzled away immediately.



Nose: 5 - tons of nectarine. I like those better than peaches.



Taste: 4 - mmm, interesting. It's a very impressive sour, but it's missing the blast of fruit I was expecting. Tastes a bit hoppy, if you can believe it.



Mouth: 5 - zillions of tiny bubbles. Expertly crafted.



Overall: 4 - reminds me of some of the best non-fruited sours I've had, but that's not what this is supposed to be.

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25A: Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance 



S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals



T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness



M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs



O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibitionNov 08, 2021"

Blend 4 (aka Vintage 2020)



A: Pops and is a gusher which is inexcusable as this has sat undisturbed for months. Several ounces wasted and sedimentation disturbed from the bottom. Color is apricot yellow/orange with a fizzy white head that dissipates almost instantaneously. Once that’s gone it actually looks flat. It’s quite hazy, nearly opaque. Certainly not much of a looker. 



S: Aroma is a great balance of fruit sweetness and tart sour characters. Huge fruit flesh characters with big peach as expected but also tangerine and apricot. Lactic acidity and sour citrus to balance, I would say the tart/sour characters are moderate on the nose. A bit of melting plastic like funk and mineral notes round it out. 



T: Taste is very delicious. Much more sour than the nose, with huge puckering tartness. Wonderful sweet fruit notes to balance, it’s very orange-family fruit forward with notes of oranges, tangerines, nectarines. Peace is primarily on the finish, but is quite nice. Pretty big lemon tartness as well. Really fantastic. 



M/D: Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, carbonation is appropriately high even though it looks flat in the glass, drinkability is very good.



O: Overall, this is an excellent beer, no doubt. Although #37 overall rating on BA seems damn high. Fair or not, I always compare these American Wild Ales to traditional Lambics, and even very well done ones such as this tend to lack the depth and complexities of most offerings from the likes of 3F and Cantillon. Regardless, still a treat, and would happily drink any day of the week. 



Happy New Year BA’s!

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4Beautiful looking beer, pungent aromas of fuzzy peach skin, under-ripe white peach flesh, lemony acidity, and a hint of peach rings and oak. the nose on this is really wonderful.



wish I could say the same about the taste - I feel like this could be used as an effective cleaning product. there is definitely a robust and complex peach flavor that is very impressive, but the overwhelming dryness and acidity detracts from that and probably drowns out some of the more subtle complexity. getting some grainy character and hints of vinegar, white grape and vanilla. don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this beer, but it was sour and acidic to the point of almost being harsh ... I tend to prefer more subtle and delicate examples of the style.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Review #500: Side Project - Fuzzy 



Batch 4 (2020) 375ml - poured into a tulip at 42°F.



Pours a moderately foggy sunglow orange, not dissimilar to the peach on the label. A thin, coarse, broken off-white head almost forms, before quickly falling, leaving only a razor-thin collar, and constant streams of effervescence. 4.25



Nose: Signature Side Project pale base, with evident crackery grains, a touch of malt, and some dusty silo. The peaches are restrained - apparent, but not loud, lending a very organic white peach aroma, much like nectarine. The acidity translates as fresh lemon juice, and just a splash of apple cider vinegar - tame, and bright. There is a ton of wet white oak - woody and musty, playing with some funky wet hay, raw honey, stone cellar, dusty attic, leather, parchment, honeysuckle, lilac, dried leaves, and peach blossoms. Not aggressive funky or tart.



Palate: Fuzzy greets the palate with a quick flash of tartness - lactic and acetic in nature, lending some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. The peaches, once more, are very natural and ripe, but not jammy. These are fruity, bright white peaches, with most of their fructose fermented out. Huge stone fruit notes of peach, nectarine, apricot, and a big plum presence. Remarkably floral, with honeysuckle, lilac, gardenia, and even a hint of honeydew melon. As the acidity curves, oak begins to show, along with a hint of sweet grain, which adds nice balance. Some farmhouse notes of hay, wet wet, stone, and earth emerge, providing that true wild touch, with the brett adding a nice dusty, sweaty, overripe element. It finishes remarkably clean, with a general stone fruit presence behind a fading acidity, some subtle grain, and drying wet white oak, with nothing really lingering.



Mouthfeel/Body: It's incredible how Side Project can produce these 8% ABV wild ales with such clean, crisp, snappy fluidity. Fuzzy is light-bodied, with no real malt weight, and quite dry, with no significant residual sugars. Perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne, but with a similar feel - airy, clean, bright, and snappy. Acidity is tart - sour, even, but definitely shy of puckering. The finish has some nice drying tannic oak. Ultra-clean.



Overall: Fuzzy is a bottle with a lofty reputation. Long considered one of the finest fruited wild ales. That's a tall order. Is it the greatest wild ale I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. Is it the greatest peach sour I've ever had? Most likely. What it most certainly is, is the definition of Side Project. Yes, it is one of the more sour offerings, using their high acid blonde base, but it isn't overbearing, and it's one of the more subtle offerings - beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that they're so great at. The tartness, the minerality, the organic nature of the fruit, the oak, the gentle funk, all meticulously blended. It really is a world-class wild ale, and one everyone should try at some point.Oct 20, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5My long time white whale, we meet at last...



As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening, we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions. The progression is beautifully subtle, while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark. Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna, with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body. This has closer to a honey appearance, whereas Anna is a hazier, paler yellow, with a larger, fluffier white head.



The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than I was expecting, delivering a delicate experience that is less funky, yet more woody. White grape, riesling wine, and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry, falling off the palate quickly. There's a hint of green olive, and it's only mildly sour, with essentially no funkiness at all. This is possibly the most wine-like experience I've gotten out of a beer. So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare. It even sweetens up over time.



Ann is absurdly refined and complex, yet exceedingly simple. It does not have the body of the other wonderful Farmstead beers, and while I love it, I think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is, as well as all the other HF shelfies, which are just so supple, easy to enjoy, and complex in their own right.



Bottled 2015, released 2019. Thanks Stanley!Oct 07, 2019"

Maman 2020 is a blend of 2 distinct threads. The first consisting of base stout aged 22 months in Heaven Hill barrels, this comprises 80% of the blend. The remaining 20% is base stout aged 27 months on Weller barrels. We tasted through a couple dozen barrels to find a blend that best exemplifies our beloved barrel aged stout, Maman. Oak, maple, marshmallow, and caramel all dominate the aroma, with waves of rich brownie batter fudge and Heath bars wrap up the palate. We always strive for a balance of flavors in our beers, and we feel the nuance and surprising drinkability make this vintage of Maman something we’re immensely proud of.



This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.



This smells like high quality chocolate truffles, cookie dough, brownies, vanilla, spicy oak, caramelly bourbon, English toffee, marshmallow, heavy roast, and light smoke.



This has been high on my list of ""must-tries"" for a long time, and it really did meet my expectations. It's a pure expression of the power of barrel - you could tell me this has chocolate or vanilla or caramel added to it, and I'd believe you. There's very little booze here, and there's great oaky complexity on the back end helping keep things balanced. There's some definite roast and bitterness - it's not just pure pastry here. 



This is medium bodied, not the thickest stout ever, but that honestly helps here - keeping it light on its feet and very drinkable. There's barely any booze to this.



It's hard to find much to fault this one for. It's truly excellent - barrel aged chocolate marshmallow chunk brownies, essentially.Feb 22, 2021"

Glowing orange-gold body of haze and near-murk — pure juice. Big head of compact, off-white bubbles. Absolutely scoopable and creamy looking. Fantastic lacing.



Heavy sweet tropical fruits on the nose, balanced with lovely floral and herbal notes, breadiness, and a slight bite of pine. Familiar Juicy Fruit characteristics of a big TH hazy, but also a yeasty element. Each whiff is a little different than the last.



Taste follows on the very front of the sip but is then overwhelmed by a starchy green element, which takes it down several notches. Still heavy tropical fruit, very juicy, with a nice semi-sweetness. The grassiness overshadows any breadiness or pine characteristics that might be present. The can describes a sharp but pleasant finish, which I was hoping meant a nice bitterness. But this is more of a sharp green, chalky note that steels from the experience.



Feel is velvety soft and wonderfully coating.Jul 07, 2022"

$20.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22



Notes via stream of consciousness: This is a more intense version of their ""doppelganger"". An inch and a quarter of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far, falling in a little bit and become rocky looking. The aroma is pretty bright with notes of orange, berries, other tropical fruit, apple, hops resins, and pine. The taste keeps it going with additional notes of mango, honeydew melon, pssionfruit, and grapefruit. The malt is sweetish and bready, supporting the hop notes. A moderate bitterness and a fair amount of acidic ""hop bite"" balance it and it finishes dry with some fruit, resin, earth, and pine lingering. The head has held up really well and the lacing is fantastic. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gently crisp carbonation and a little zest from all of the hop acids, and then smooth towards the finish because of all the extra proteins. This one is really nicely balanced.

4.68/5  rDev +1.5%
look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.756 weeks old. Can to wine glass.



Look: Pours a hazy dark orange with a fluffy and stable white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.



Smell: A combination of ripe orange and tropical mango and pineapple. Hoppy, dank and sweet. A bit sharp.



Taste: Citrusy notes of orange, tangerine and grapefruit with subtle tropical hints. Not as sweet es the smell suggests. Zesty, bitter and slightly sharp.



Feel: Very juicy. Medium carbonation. Smooth and silky.



Overall: Even though smell and look were almost perfect right from the beginning, it took a bit for the taste to fully develop. A bit too green and bitter when cold, it developed into a smooth and nicely balanced juice with just the right amount of everything. One of the best Tree House beers I've had so far.Apr 25, 2022"

Super hazy yellow-orange color with a thick white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. (not my words)



Smell is juicy fruity dough



Taste is aggressive but balanced wonderfulness (if you like dank & hazy) so smooth that sadness permeates your empty glass. Just a bitterness reminder on your tongue that lasts. It tastes like sad regret.



Feel is unicorn & rainbows

Taste: Hints of melon and toffee underneath with the more assertive fruits garnering most of the attention; very dank, with orange pith joined by mango and pineapple and passionfruit; considerable but not overwhelming bitterness, after the swallow with an herbal peppery finish



Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation

This is absolutely one of the best Tree House IPAs that I’ve had yet – it’s a stunner. It’s so soft and juicy – peach, mango, grapefruit, orange, whatever else you want.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Cloudy, dirty gold color. Solid two-finger head which lumpily and slowly recedes, leaving a spider web of lace on the glass.



Dry, weedy aroma of plenty of post-boil dry hopping. Very vegetalThere's also some alcohol warming, oily pale malt smell.



Moderate body (which is thinner than I expected from Hill Farmstead. The carbonation is elevated making the beer spritzy. The malt portion is lighter but lasts throughout the tasting. The Citra hop is also present throughout the tasting. Less oily than the smell implies but there's still some background alcohol warmth. Long bitter aftertaste.Aug 07, 2022"

Pours an almost turbid golden burnt orange body capped with two fingers of lush, fluffy, white foam; good head retention yields a thin layer of cap, a hearty, expansive collar, and generous spread of webby/spotty lacing coating the walls of the glass.



Aroma opens to deeply floral citrus refined to fresh orange juice accents and a fluffy lime underlay; papaya rind and soft melon ease over the middle as tinges of black peppercorn phased effortlessly into flaky, plush malt profile on the back end of the bouquet.



Taste shows mango upfront grazed with pineapple tart transitioning to lemon meringue against a fluffy malt base over the mid-palate; melon touches the back end, a briefly sweet interlude as musty grass and delicate, underripe passionfruit and grapefruit finish.



Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation, dispersing a hoppy twang fusing to juiciness over the mid-palate; the back end highlights a zesty character invigorating a taut, drying finish.



Waves of stimulation texture effortlessly attenuated character, seeing a pillowy malt profile support zesty citrus and pangs of sweeter tropical nectar in playful contrast; common with Hill's DIPAs, stimulating yet universally approachable displays.Oct 29, 2021"

look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5L: Gorgeous cream hazy wheat. About 1/2 inch of frothy head with lacing that hangs on the side of the glass.



S: Aroma comes bounding out of the can. The Citra is overwhelming, in a good way. Stone fruit, papaya, ripe melon. Wow.



T: Citra at the front, leading to pine/resin, with sweet fruit here and there. Not an overwhelming alcohol-flavor either, despite the 8%



F: This is quite effervescent, with a peppery and dry finish. Just an absolutely perfect amount of carbonation - enough of a bite to notice, but also simultaneously juicy and mouth-watering.



O: This is a spectacular beer. What puts this double with Citra above many others is that it hits every piece perfectly - aroma, taste, mouthfeel. Many juicy IPAs pack in the aroma or flavor, but really miss with the high alcohol content and mouth feel and either come off as too strong, or flat. I grabbed this at the brewery today in a can and was so excited to have it - I'm looking forward to having it again once things open up a bit and growlers are back. Grab some cans while they are still around if you are within driving distance within VT.Oct 24, 2020"

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Re-reviewing 4/7/2022, the second time I’ve enjoyed this beer.



330mL (best by 10/13/2019, so bottled 10/13/2016) into a Westmalle chalice. 



Pours a clean deep reddish-brown mahogany with minimal white head, slow steady carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Evenly distributed particulates of yeasty sediment in suspension throughout the liquid are illuminated by overhead light. 



Aroma is bready and sweet, dryly fruity. Dates and figs, cinnamon and other spices, brown sugar/caramel, light tobacco—so many smells intermingle like wafting smoke, constantly changing. Not strong or powerful, just wonderfully complex and deep. 



Taste is likewise sweet and sugary, with so many layers of flavor to pick apart. Brown sugar; rum-soaked dates, figs, and prunes; candi sugar; warm yeasty bread; smoky leather/pipe tobacco. Just a touch of warming alcohol as it goes down—given the high ABV it’s well hidden. 



Mouthfeel is wonderfully deep and full, with gently prickly carbonation that allows the beer to dance on the palate without ever getting heavy or syrupy. Finishes semi-dry and clean. Just right. 



Overall just an outstanding beer, obviously one of the best within its style if not overall one of the best beers in production. World class. 

___________________________________________



Below is my previous review from 10/6/2011, for posterity:



Rating 4.52/5 (look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5)



330mL bottle (best by 8/29/2010 on the cap) poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Mahogany brown color with a thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly - nice carbonation continues to rise to the surface.



Aroma is dark fruits, figs, dates, brown sugar, spice, rum, and a hint of molasses. Smells exquisite.



Taste is rich and complex. Sweet dark caramel malt, spice, booze, figs, and raisins. Super smooth, chewy mouthfeel. Fills every taste bud with a complex blend of flavors.



This beer totally lives up to the hype. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the head - but this beer is also 4+ years old, which may account for that. If I try another one I'll make sure to get it fresh.



(Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.)Apr 07, 2022"

Tried many tripels/quads from St. Bernardus, Chimay, La Trappe and others (mostly on tap) the same week, but the depth and complexity of this one is a step above. Pours dark, light head without much density, not a huge nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Not malt-forward, heavy but balanced, with background flavors of raisin, leather, brown sugar, ginger and clove, and a surprisingly short finish and just a bit of bite. Small sips provide revelation after revelation. If you can ignore the hype and the crazy prices on the secondary market, this is 100% worthy of all the praise.Mar 24, 2022"

Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.



While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10.Jan 29, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle with no label and a gold cap into a chalice glass. I purchased six bottles dated ""12.10.24"" which I understand to mean they were bottled on October 12, 2021 and the ""best by"" date is three years after bottling or October 12, 2024. I also received a bottle dated ""19.01.14"" which means it was bottled on January 19, 2011 and the ""best by"" date is January 19, 2014. I purchased these bottles online on December 10, 2021 at westvleterenshop.com for $228.70 USD (Beer $149.00, Shipping $72.99, tax $6.71). The scores will be for the new bottle but I will include a review after for the old bottle just for fun complete with scores.



APPEARANCE: pours a dark, brown color with two fingers tan head that slowly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, I swirled the bottle before final pour so there are larger bits of sediment that fell to bottom of glass, surprisingly the beer is not highly carbonated, it's not flat but maybe less than average carbonation, there is light lacing on the glass.



SMELL: dark fruits like fig and raisin, there is some black licorice and chocolate, bread, the 10.2% alcohol is clearly present.



TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially bread, figs and raisins, black licorice and chocolate, the alcohol is also present, less sweet than some other beers in this style.



PALATE: lower carbonation gave this a more creamy mouthfeel.



OVERALL: to me this is not the ""best beer in the world"", it's not even the best Quad, it's a good beer don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this beer immensely and would be pleased to have it again if I'm ever in Belgium but I will never pay $228.70 USD to drink this again, I can think of two Quads I like better, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus and they are way more affordable, my opinion is that the scarcity and high cost of this beer has created an undeserved amount of hype and influenced people to score it higher that it deserves, I do not regret buying this beer, I can always make more money, I would recommend to anyone in Belgium but would not recommend anyone pay $228.70 to obtain this good not great beer.



Look 3.5 Smell 3.75 Taste 4 Feel 3.50 Overall 4



APPEARANCE: pours a dark brown color with very little head that dissipated quickly until there was no head remaining, I swirled the bottle on the last pour, there was very little sediment in the bottom, lower carbonation but it's still present after almost 11 years, no lacing on the glass.



SMELL: initially sweet brown sugar and an earthy note of figs and raisins, I can't perceive the alcohol at all, not as complex on the nose as a more recent bottle.



TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet brown sugar, the earthy note is dominant but there are figs and raisins, less complex than a more recent bottle.



PALATE: very low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel.



OVERALL: I would not recommend aging any beer as long as 11 years, the biggest issue is carbonation will begin to fail, the complexity is degraded, the alcohol was less noticeable but the pleasant aspects of the taste are diminished as well, I would not recommend aging, I know you can but, it's not as good, I would drink this beer as soon as possible.Jan 16, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5Received as part of NBW BIF #13 and just now getting to it. BB date was 12/22 so I am guessing it was about 4 years old.

Poured the color of cold brew coffee and sports a manilla color head which leaves copious lacing.

The aroma was stone fruit and malts, I tried to find spices but failed. Still, excellent aroma.

The taste, wow; while it pretty much followed the aroma, the layers and power of flavors is impressive. Stone fruit mingling with biscuit like malts and they made an excellent pair.

The feel was very good, way too easy to drink. I expected something more viscous but this really works.

OA, excellent beer and so glad I got to try it!Dec 26, 2021"

First off I think this is the coolest bottle I’ve ever had. Who else could get away with no label?! I don’t get a ton off of the nose, but I can tell it’s a quad and I’m liking it. It’s a gorgeous looking beer when poured too. It has an impressive full mouthfeel with the perfect carbonation. There’s a bit of a tart dry finish that I really like as well.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 5Thanks to Coronaeus for this, probably my biggest 'Want' ever. This 330ml bottle, part of a limited, labeled, North American release a few years ago, had a best before date that I couldn't read. Poured into 12oz tulip. Poured the expected and anticipated very deep chestnut of the style, with about a half-inch tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left no lacing.



The aroma had all the big stone fruit scents one expects, solid, earthy grains, and a touch of yeast spice and esters. Maybe, just maybe, a touch of alcohol heat as well.



On the tongue, all those aspects were apparent, just amplified. The fruitiness was bolder, the malts stronger, the yeast had more bite, and there was certainly a bit of alcohol heat at the back end.



The body, while full, was a bit lighter than I was expecting, making the beer float over the palate rather than flooding it. The finish wasn't nearly as sweet as I would have thought, and dried out quickly.



Drinkability was awesome, you could easily drink a couple of these without getting bored.



Overall, a truly great beer, worthy of all its multitude of praises. A must try for any beer lover.Dec 05, 2021"

That said beyond being a monastic Quad I do not presently recall any specific points/features of this beer and have not read any reviews below (yet!)... I don't know what to expect, am I 100% honestly going to find this a 'Score:100' beer? 

This is my 2,000th beer rating/review so it had to something with the prospect of wowing me; fingers crossed... 

L- Dark chestnut red-brown. Pours with minor haze with some sediment left in the bottle. Head forms swiftly, take the pour slowly. 3Cm pale tan head. ps@+10mins a patch of bubbles holds the whole way down. 

S- Quite malty with a light hint of spice.

T- Woah!! Ok, well THAT got my attention. Instantly deep and roasty-rich, notable ABV% brushing my palate and a good balancing hoppy-bitter aspect into the finish.

F- Big, rich + 'visible' ABV% but well balanced by hops.

O- Made for slow-sipping. Lovely, complex and big yet mostly refined. The ABV% is unusually loud for 10.2% and that surprises me. (I had an 18.1% yesterday less shouty on the palate than this one). FWIW I'm tasting this on a clean palate. My wife tried it after eating chocolate and didn't get the ABV-zing. Nice. Would I drink it again? Yes if I could drive to the brewery and buy it for peanuts. Worth the after-market price? Certainly once...

Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! 

330ml bottle BB: [xx]-01-2026 Euro16-00 Bought from [xx shop]/Belgium as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London. The xx's being to anonymise people who perhaps have breached their required agreement with the brewery not to resell this beer.Aug 07, 2021"

Poured cold to a champagne coup…closest to a chalice I have. Nose is light floral, with a strong funky bready yeast. Thin effervescent head that maintains throughout. Color is a dark amber, with a few floaters. Taste is a solid crackery malt, with a constant hit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, with an earthy heaviness, and a ton of carbonation. As it warms, there is a stone fruit vibe that really overtakes the tongue. Alcohol doesn’t bite, but brings on some warming fairly quickly. I’d say it’s a great representation of the style, but hell, isn’t this that misleading? This is OG for the style, from which others should compare. I should let the next half of the title warm, as that seems to really bring out more complexity. The flavor lingering is really satisfying.



The wife asked if it was worth $50 a bottle? Is any beer “worth” $50 a bottle. Yes. Plus it’s a story of history, with a present day support of a simpler lifestyle and dedication to higher purpose.Aug 01, 2021"

Taste: Really thick and coating right away. Big vanilla barrel note that transitions to rye spiciness. Chocolatety and mild sweetness. Kind of separates into beer and barrel factions before coalescing again by the end of the glass.

S - Nothing noticeable.



T - Exquisite. Truly delicious. Deep, some sweetness, and excellent complexity of flavors. As compared to many other RIS, no bitterness at all, and not too sweet. Really great. ABV extremely well hidden.

Hooooooo boyyyyy. Parabola. Finally. We don’t see much FW here in Mass, but thankfully a trip to Philly found me at Half Time on the way back, where I ended up with this gem, as well as Perennial Abraxas! I’m so hyped to try this so let’s just get into it



Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing



This beer relies heavily on the bourbon barrels in the nose, with most of the complexity coming from them. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy whiskey, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, dark cherry, toffee, smoky tobacco, plum, milk chocolate, and toasted coconut



It is a bit less complex in taste, but I still think it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, dark chocolate, toasted oak, brown sugar, and sweet bourbon. The swallow brings notes of spicy whiskey, plum, toasted oak, coconut, roasty coffee, tobacco, and toffee



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and oily beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent heat



This wasn’t mind blowing by any means, but it is pretty great. I grabbed a bottle from Half Time as well to cellar. Let’s see how this is holding up in 2 yearsMar 27, 2022"

Rating the 2015 bottle I just had. 



L: Almost black and pretty opague. Not too foamy. 

S: Chocolate, cherries, and coffee or maybe espresso

T: My best way to describe this is that it tastes like someone poured bourbon or whiskey into a glass of red wine and mixed it with a chocolate bar-- but somehow some cherries fell in. Very strong, 

F: Smooth and thick like I like my women.

O: This is so boozy and sweet without actually being too sweet like wine could be. Not sure how else to describe it. I took big sips but didn't rush it. I was so happyMar 21, 2022"

L: Very dark brown (won't call it black), tiny head that recedes quickly and with little lacing.

S: Raisins, roasty, some barrel.

T: All sorts of things happening. When colder it matches the nose; as it warms you get rich dark chocolate, a little vanilla, and some booziness as well.

F: Thick, smooth, dessert-like.

O: Definitely should have opened this a couple years earlier but it's still one of the greats.Feb 21, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5It is difficult for me to get as hyperbolic as the average ratings for Parabola. But that's OK; I'm an old man and a high ABV (13.6 on the 2020 vintage) no longer impresses me. But, this is a wonderfully smooth RIS and it was enjoyed after-dinner along with two friends. Another year cellared will take care of two rough edges: lingering hops; and a fuller melding of the dark fruit and chocolate, like the dessert that Parabola should supplant.



I am an enthusiast for FW and particularly how its owner (Duvel) is smart enough to let FW do its thing. But that is another story littered throughout enough of my reviews of the 7 other brewers Duvel owns; all I like to varying degrees.Jan 16, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.512 ounce bottle, 2021 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, dark fruit/cherry, toffee, chocolate and earthiness. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some oak, caramel, wheat, licorice, burnt/charred malt and rye. There's a lot going on here! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, creamy and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a really good overall brew. Wish I would have bought more of this when I was able to, will definitely buy more the next time I can!Dec 30, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. This is the 2021 version, aged in bourbon, rye, and wheated whiskey barrels. It's hard to imagine I've gotten this far in my beer-drinking life and have never yet tasted any Parabola.



Appearance: entirely black with a finger and a half of thick, creamy dark-tan foam atop. Beers like this really have a head-start on looking good, don't they?



Smell: wood, malt, whiskey; maybe a little chocolate thrown in for good measure. There're notes of dark fruit as well, which you know I always love.



Taste: rich, that's for damn sure. There's dark cherry and raisin and date and prune, of course, but also just a bit of oak and whiskey that add an extra dimension to the fruit and sweetness and booze. Very, very good indeed. Really, very wonderful.



Mouthfeel: thick body with a good carbonation and plenty of smooth, rich creaminess.



Overall: you never know what you're walking into when it comes to a beer that has a big reputation, whether it's an oldie or something super hyped. This beer is just downright excellent.Sep 16, 2021"

Smell - Dark fruit. Plums. Very vinous, rounded out with some chocolate and roasted coffee character. 4.75

The taste is sweet with chocolate, cherry, wood and liquor.



It has a medium mouthfeel with a small amount of bubbly carbonation.  The finish starts complex with the licorice, chocolate and cherry, then fades to a long dry bittersweetness.



Wow, what a beer.  It's the most complex stout I've had but the flavors are never muddled; always clear.  I give it a 5.9 out of 6.Sep 05, 2021"

Pours less billowy than many of the HF offerings, with little head retention or lacing to speak of. This is a superbly well-rounded and nuanced offering, with all of the characteristics of a rustic saison, a fine effervescent white wine, and a barrel aged sour all-in-one, with no one attribute dominating the others. $60/750ml is very high, but this is barely over into 'worth it' territory

This smells like hay, minerally funk, lemon candy, grassy funk, honey, oak, white wine, grape, sweet floral funk, and pear skin.



This is absolutely phenomenal, and represents the best of what Hill Farmstead is capable of. The recipe appears to be a cross of two of my favorite beers that Hill Farmstead has ever done - Vera Mae and Le Sarrasin - so this beer has been on my list for a while now. It's got this wonderfully fresh and lemony taste to it, like funky lemon candy, with that rustic funk - pear, citrus, grassy, a little bit of herbal and mineral character, along with lots of oak spice. There's also an outstanding sweet floral honey-like flavor.



This is light bodied, effervescent, and very drinkable. Taking down an entire 750 of this one would be absolutely no problem.



This is in the top 3 of all Hill Farmstead beers I've ever had, and it's maybe even the best beer overall that I've ever had. It's honestly perfect.Apr 21, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour. 



2018. Served from a 750mL bottle. Decanted. Reviewed from notes.Apr 08, 2022"

Vintage 2007, ABV is 5%. 300 gram of Schaerbeek cherries are added per liter beer. Aged in oak barrels. Deep red colour, huge pink head. Intense aroma of ripe cherries, hints of red wine vinegar. Equally intense flavour of sour cherries, not as lemony as the Lou Pepe Framboise. Drank it a bit too cold, still refreshing and pleasant to drink.Mar 18, 2021"

Review 1100!! I figured I’d bust out a special bottle for the occasion, and what’s better than the highest rated Gueuze on BA? Well, Gueuze-inspired I should say, based on recent thread. Whatever the fuck we wanna call it, I’m beyond excited to try this so let’s get into it



After a long and annoying struggle with the double cork breaking inside the bottle, it pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing



Wow, this is super bright in the nose, just an absolute. punch of funk. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, sharp oak, old leather, wet hay, vinegar, apple skin, dried apricot, tart white wine (surprising given the red wine barrel aging), and general floral notes. Really all over the place but fantastic



While it's not as incredible in taste, it is still very damn good, just less sharp than you'd expect based on the aroma. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting wet hay, lemon zest, jammy apricot, white wine vinegar, pear, white pepper, dry oak, and light leather. The swallow brings notes of bright white wine, stone, lemon yogurt, orange juice, apple skin, straw, and light honey



A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and zesty beer. Finishes very dry with a balanced tartness



Super annoying cork aside, this is a fantastic treat of a beer! There's something special about this one doing a very convincing Belgian impersonation, in the most flattering way. I need to get more to cellar, cheers BA!May 08, 2022"

750ml corked and caged bittle - poured into a Riesling/Zinfandel stem at 45°F.



Pours a slightly foggy translucent honey-golden, really verging on orange, like a West Coast IPA. A finger of coarse, sticky, sudsy off-white head forms, with fair retention, and settling to a decent collar, with weak, spotty lacing. Clings to the glass like whiskey. Really a beautiful beer.



Nose: This one travels. No shortage of funk here. Tons of damp hay and wine-soaked oak, with plenty of bright lemon juice and rind. There's ample leather book binding, dusty stone cellar, petrichor, magnolia blossom, and a really dense note of patchouli, with some sweet apricot and marmalade threadinf through. Some funky stable, sea shell minerality, and sweaty brett emerge, but the funk is balanced by plenty of bright fruitiness. Huge nod to Cantillon here.



Palate: Duck Duck Gooze emerges with an impressively balanced acidity. Like biting into a ripe stone fruit, there's a bright *POP* of tartness, but it immediately steps back, becoming more of a lemony tang. Lemon oil, orange juice, apricot, and crabapple lend bright fruity notes, with undertones of cabernet grape, cranberry, unripe plum, and coriander seed. The tartness begins to rapidly subside, showing quite a bit of grain - dusty, with hulls. An almost Gueuze level of funk presents itself in the form of wet hay, damp wood, old musty stable air, milkweed, and a touch of herbal flowery notes with just a whisper of sweaty funk. The tartness completely disappears, and the finish shows wheaty grain, grass, lemon essence, white oak, and just a touch of grapefruit oil that clings to the palate.



Mouthfeel/Body: Absolutely stunning. It's crisp, airy, and quenchingly dry with a shimmering minerality, but there's definitely some soft body which lends presence. The effervescence is truly perfect. Champagne. Zippy, airy, fluffy, and fizzy, but soft and supple. An oily feel lingers.



Overall: This is perhaps the most stunning American wild ale I've had in a long time, perhaps ever. I'm not sure if this is Method Traditionelle or not, but either way, this really is a masterpiece. A sweet grain presence, incredibly balanced acidity, ample funk contrasting against beautiful bright fruity notes, and it all comes together so seamlessly and flawlessly, this has truly transcended the style itself. Simply stunning.Jan 01, 2021"

4.47/5  rDev -3.2%
look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Pours a dirty darker straw color; cloudy but see through; white head that laces quite beautifully, a dense film lingers and lingers.



The aroma literally jumps out of the glass on this beer; it has an essential oil like brightness to it, incredibly vibrant. A mix of fresh in season fruits; nothing tropical to me just local summer fruits, but with an extra citrus like bite to it; a little bit of vegetal dank on the finish, it cuts short of onion garlic territory for me.



Taste is much of the same but the beer becomes less fruity more citrus, pithy, with a pretty nice minor sweet malt presence; slight resin/sap aftertastes.



This is a double IPA that is for sure; it has a pretty hefty body, higher end of medium. A very clean drinking beer, dry and biting bitterness on the finish, prickly sappy tingling on the tongue. Also letting you know this is a double IPA is the slight alcohol presence on the finish, no overbearing by any means but present.



Well it is easy to see why this beer has the reputation it does. The aroma alone is intoxicating but the flavors and feel combine to make this a very good beer; I love the bite and big hop presence on such an aromatic beer. Lovely beer.Sep 05, 2022"

4.14/5  rDev -10.4%
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4I've never come across this highly regarded beer, so was pleasantly surprised to see it on tap when I was out to dinner last night. The appearance was that of.....beer. Cloudy and medium yellow, with almost no head. The lack of head could certainly be chalked up to the fact that it had probably been a minute or two between the pour and its arrival at my table. Regardless, while there was nothing wrong with the appearance, nothing particularly stood out either. 



The nose was a different story. I'm desensitized to IPA aromas at this point, but this beer smelled amazing Loads of citrus, mango and other tropical notes. Simply an excellent smelling beer. 



The taste was very nice, but not as tropical as the nose. Grapefruit was the only taste I could pick out, but whatever else was there it was above average, but didn't blow me away (keeping in mind I'm not a big lover of IPAs). The feel, however was amazing. Very full, creamy and pillowy. Absolutely excellent. 



Overall, I though this was a very good beer, led by the aroma and the feel. I hope to be able to luck into some bottles sometime right around a NBS BIF so I can share it with others.Sep 04, 2022"

4.36/5  rDev -5.6%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.25From a 16.9oz bottle, dated 07/29/22. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.



Pours a just barely hazed honey-gold with two-plus fingers of pouffy, shaving cream-like foam. Retention is excellent, leaving a fat bubbly-sudsy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing.



Nose is sweet, malty, and layered with aromas of orange peel and pine needles.



Taste is as expected, leaning into the sweet and malty end of balanced. The earthy-woody pine needle, resinous character is prominent, along with caramel sweetness, oily orange peel and a squeeze of lemon.



Feel is clean, just a little too brisk to pass as smooth (entirely in a good way) and no more than medium bodied with bright, zesty carbonation. There’s a cheerful hop oily tingle on the tongue and a slight boozy warmth in the gullet.



As always when rating MBC bottles, overall score is marked down 0.25 in recognition of the stupid, overpriced pint-plus bottles. Because principles, right? (Replaces a 4.46 rating without a review from 11/05/15… thank you, Dr. J. for the rare opportunity to have this one again).Aug 15, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5On tap at Sabatini's in Exeter pa yesterday.



Looks very good in the glass. Honey yellow body with a nice white head. This eventually shrinks to a thin ring, good lacing early on.



Delightful hoppy aroma with a side of mixed fruit favoring the non citrus.



On tasting, smooth, hoppy, delicious. Fruit notes confirm the nose. Very easy drinking, abv fairly well hidden but you get the feel of it.



Mouth close to full, finish manages to be clean, but full of hop flavor.



Overall, have missed out on this one the last few times it was at Sabz. Not this time. Beautifully crafted dipa. Seemingly simple, but a lot of thought has gone into producing this classic.May 29, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25Canned on 7/29/22; consumed on 9/2/22



Pours a turbid, dark orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of rich cap, a massive, fluffy collar, and myriad spattering of chunky lacing tossed around the walls of the glass.



Aroma highlights mango gummies accented with a slight mustiness hinting toward a boggier overlay of guava peel and tropical compost over time; a dense, bready malt backing remains prevalent as light papaya and melon brings a soft freshness to the back end.



Taste offers mossy mango contrasting tangy orange juice upfront, with lingering guava engaging distant melon over the mid-palate while sweet, boggy-dank sensations flow alongside a lime-pineapple juiciness on the back end.



Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a moderate, rounded carbonation soon easing to resoundingly creamy, smooth textures; a juicy twang levels density past the mid-palate to an effortless, pillowy grit lingering on the finish.



A tropical hop smoothie, extensively creamy and leveled with weighty resins in-flux with the rampant saturation; a busy density attenuated to Tree House's usual high standard of NEIPA.Sep 03, 2022"

Smell - The nose had an orangey nose with a malty backbone. 



Taste - The beer tasted more like orange juice than beer. It was like Sunny Delight got poured into a bitter IPA. There was a maltiness amid the body. Bitter orange rind lingered in the finish.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Tree House Brewing Co. ""JJJuliusss""

16 fl. oz. can coded ""JJJUST GGGREAT 04/29/22 07:48:00"". Sampled on 05/15/22



Notes via stream of consciousness: The can that I have in front of me is labeled JJJuliusss without an exclamation point and the label is white, not orange, but I'm pretty sure this is the same beer. The question is, what is it? I get all of these Julius beers confused. Ahh, this is Julius with extra hops added, first brewed for their 3rd anniversary. It's poured a very cloudy orange body beneath a finger's width of creamy off-white foam. As is the case with all Treehouse beers the head holds up really well and it leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. That hasn't happened yet but I can tell that it will based on experience. The aroma is fruity but also malty. It's sweetish and grainy with notes of orange, peach, and mango. I wish I had a Julius to compare it to but I drank them all! Ha ha! The flavor delivers that sweetish malt and I can taste the oasts in it. It's threaded through with notes of orange, peach, mango, melon, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine. It's got a median bitterness but also a lot of acidic ""hop bite"" that balances it and eventually leads to a dry finish where resin and pine linger. In the mouth it's medium bodied but fluffy and smooth due to all of the extra proteins. As expected the head held up well and I now have craggy rings of lacing throughout the entire glass. I honestly can't say how much more aromatic or flavorful this is than the standard Julius but I think I enjoyed it more. I'll have to try to get a hold of more of both to do a side-by-side.

Big orange in the nose. Hints of passionfruit, plum and gummy bears.



Same lovely mix of tropical fruits and orange citrus in the taste. A little herbal greeness and light pith in the finish creates some great balance that prevents the beer from being sweet.



Very soft, pillowy feel with restrained carbonation.



A top of class NEIPA. Tons of depth among the varied fruit flavors along with good light bitterness for balance.Feb 21, 2022"

Smell: Orange. Grapefruit. Sweet and dank.



Taste: Ripe citrus fruits. Mostly orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Medium sweetness with a zesty, slightly bitter finish. 



Feel: Full and juicy. Low carbonation. Slightly sharp.



Overall: Typical Tree House IPA which could easily be mistaken for a higher ABV DIPA (which is great). Rather edgy than smooth, but still nicely balanced. Overall a very good brew and a prime example of the style.Feb 05, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.522oz bomber bottle. most likely a 2019 bomber based on the listed abv of 11% on the bottle, but was told this was a 2018 vintage of Morning Wood.



Poured into Durobar Charente glass.



Appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. Light lacing. good staying power. Thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down. 



Smell: Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon, smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. Hints of chocolate, oak, and bourbon.



Taste: Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. Hint of Dad's brand root beer candies and cola. Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. This is complex, superbly balanced, and flat out really really tasty. Easily exceeds my expectations for sure.



Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. Slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. Very smooth and not any booze at all. 



Overall: Finally! Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO. This beer is rich without being overly sweet. The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. The balance is also quite impressive as well. Put this beer on your must try list if you haven't. Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. What's not to like? The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure.Feb 04, 2022"

4.53/5  rDev -2.2%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Damn, the minute I opened this I was punched in the face with maple - it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all ... In terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. A lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. It is pretty viscous. Back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon, oak, bourbon, and chocolate. All of those aromas are quite strong - so I am not really getting much in the way of coffee.



Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor, but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past. There is much more roasted malt, chocolate, smoked malts with some slight meaty notes, and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. Feel is thick, full bodied and luscious. Moderate carbonation. Sort of drier on the finish.Feb 03, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5I got this in a trade, and the date is smudged off :-( 



Appearance: Poured 1/4th of a glass every time so not too much head. Pitch black of course. Some lacing. 



Aroma: Impressive -- maple, coffee, and smoke all shine through. 



Flavor: Overall sweet almost like a milk stout. Maple syrup throughout, strong coffee throughout as well. Milk chocolate. The barrels come through if you pay attention. There's a slight smokiness on the back end, which is such a great addition. There is absolutely no heat. The advertised flavors do not lie... however I don't get much more than that. Not a bad thing but perhaps was hoping for more. 



Palate/Finish: Medium but oily and sticky. Very smooth, no carb. I do wish this was thicker, but I also realize that this is a porter so I won't knock it too much. Finishes with more coffee and sticky maple. 



Overall: This is a very good beer and it deserves some accolade. I was hoping for something to 'chew' on, but at the same time, the style *is* porter, and I do admire that. The alcohol is completely hidden, and the maple/coffee flavors shine so well in the flavor and in the aroma. This is what impressed me most. On the other hand, it's not the most complex imperial porter I've had, and it's a little lactos-y. Overall, I'm gonna say this is an A beer, but not an A+.Oct 04, 2020"

L: Dark and beautiful as a porter should be. Great tan head with good lacing throughout the entire (short) life of the beer.

S: Slightly sweet and inviting. Maybe a hint of bourbon on the nose (but my nose is pretty weak in this area.)

T: This is my #1 beer so I personally feel that is is the best porter I've ever tried. I routinely buy every bottle I can find. Great taste that's slightly sweet without any alcohol burn/aftertaste. Smooth tasting with a hint of maple and bourbon. Best porter or stout I've had.

F: Everything a porter should be, smooth and silky with a clean and hearty feel in the mouth.



My #1 beer!!!! Closely followed by Untitled Art White Chocolate Macadamia, Untitled Art Hazelnut, CBS, and a little further down the list, Wicked Weed German Chocolate Cake just to give you some reference.Jun 28, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.75Pours a dull, matte pink that resembles the fresh of grapefruit. No foam on this bottle pour. Pour is from the bottom 1/3 of the bottle. Aroma is strong raspberry (had it all caps in my notes). Stone and grass add depth, before a tart finish dries out the nose and cues a sip. Flavor profile is raspberries through and through. Stone, grass, and grapefruit round out each sip. It's sweet, then tart. Mouth feel is creamy with a mild silt throughout. Thickness is medium-thick, coming in on the more full side of saisons. Overall, a plump, ripe saison jammed up and full of raspberries.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Every super hero has a skill, they have a talent, they have a gift. They have the ability to do something that no one else can do and they use it for good. Lawson's finest has a gift for hops and they do good bringing a double dose of their best efforts to the New England craft beer community.



Double Sunshine pours with a strikingly hazy and golden orange appearance. Looking the part of most hazy ale, the beer floats a creamy dense meringue of tarnish froth before enticing the nose with a brisk and brazen citrus scent with an herbal perfume of citronella in a ripe, roaring and racy tone. Deliciously smooth and velvety in its malty upstart, the early palate is met with cereal, honey, caramel and cream.



As the malts settle on the palate, the hops simply begin to blossom with a bounty of branch-ripe Valencia orange, tangerine, mandarin and blood orange while inviting more fruits of nectarine and mango to add even more racy flavors. Red grapefruit tighten its hop taste as a late plunge into juicy notions of sherbet and push-ups. Trending firmly bitter with smooth pine, fragrant woods, citrus peel and herbal and a slightly dank vegetal bite.



Medium-full in body, the beer's bold flavors and creamy upstart finishes remarkably dry and resinous. A long but smooth bitterness is lasting with fruit peels and herb for a session that's classically hazy up front and traditionally bitter to finish- a best of both worlds.Sep 16, 2022"

A touch of mango but mostly citrus forward. Grapefruit is the central flavor that comes to mind. It's sticky, sappy, chewy. The chewiness of this is really what I'm enjoying the most. I remember this being much more tropical and less citrus forward when I had had it before but those are blurry memories from beer festivals and my palate memory is much more developed now than it was at that time. However, this is still a really nice DIPA that doesn't really have any rough edges.Feb 27, 2022"

Mostly clear with strong lacing; Nose is a bit light, fruity; taste starts a little sweet, with a hint of burn, but balances quickly and then slowly becomes bitter.

look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.56 weeks old. Can to wine glass.



Look: Pours a golden-brownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing. Floaters all over the place.



Smell: Piney, resiny, somehow woody and slightly smoky. Also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears.



Taste: Less intense, more balanced, but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted. Resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel, and something woody and smoky popping up here and there. Medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish.



Feel: Clean and full at the same time. Medium carbonation. Quite crushable.



Overall: Very complex west coast style IIPA that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness. Some unexpected notes (smoke, gummy bears) are also in the mix, but everything fits in seamlessly. I‘d definitely locate this one somewhere close to Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder. Great beer that once again demonstrates the versatility of Hill Farmstead brewing high quality stuff from different styles.May 04, 2022"

Well damn, my first Hill Farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on BA! I know they’re more known for their Saisons, but I’m very happy to try this



Pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing



For the style, this isn’t super juicy in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon, lemon zest, bready malt, light caramel, peppery hops, fresh grass, and grapefruit rind



It’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, tangerine, overripe melon, weedy hops, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest, orange juice, bready malt, peppery hops, fresh grass, and light tangerine



A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry and very balanced



Holy shit, this is a great beer. Super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv. I need moreApr 06, 2022"

look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.75Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one, from his massive NBS BIF # 15 hit. 16oz can (dated 8/18/20) poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a solid medium-dark orange color with a bit more than a half-inch of white head that had good retention and lacing.



A big blast of hops popped out of the can upon opening. Some citrus-orange scents, and some light frootiness. Very low grain presence. 



Fairly similar on the tongue, with a bit of alcohol presence as well.



The body was fairly typical for the style, smooth and light.



Drinkability was good, especially sine the alcohol seemed to fade out a bit as it spent some time in the glass.



Overall, even though almost certainly faded, this still a really nice beer. Would like to try it fresh some time. Worth grabbing if you see it.Apr 05, 2022"

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25can into glass

Bought at brewery, canned 12 days prior.

Brief, white head. Cloudy, medium orange, with a bit of amber on the side of the glass. Candied tangelo peel, mango, a touch of allspice and light caramelized malt, makes up the aroma. First ⅔ of taste is very good, with a candied tangerine peel, some mango and off-dry ( a wine term for nearly a complete lack of sweetness ), medium toasted, caramelized malts. As soon as these flavors fade, a sharp tangerine peel bite comes in and crowds out all else, for a long finish.Nov 13, 2021"

4.51/5  rDev -2.6%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer was bright yellow in color with a bubbly white head that left generous lacing. 



Smell - The nose was a bouquet of fresh lemons surrounded by dankness. 



Taste - Initially, fresh but dry lemons led the profile. There was just a touch of sweetness like the East Coast style, but it was not liquid candy. The dankness really came through in the finish. 



Mouthfeel - The body was nicely thick with an almost gritty body. Carbonation somehow survived the viscosity. 



Overall - This is a great IPA, but I have had better.Aug 29, 2021"

Consumed 6/2/21



It says to drink by 6/8/21, so is this almost old?! Either way, it’s still fantastic. It looks, smells, and feels world class. It’s one of the best balanced IPAs I’ve had in a really long time. I would have guessed this is a 6.5% abv and not 8.2%. I love the bitterness throughout. Not West Coast style, but East Coast hazy like. I’m so happy to try this guy and will drink my remaining cans before they’re officially old!Jun 03, 2021"

Aromas of strawberry and chocolate are abundant. Subtle vanilla. Smells amazing with all the strawberry. 



Taste is that of the aroma. Lots of strawberry through and through. Chocolate mixes in with a light lingering vanilla finish. Really damn good. 



Feel is what I anticipated. Thick and viscous. Mouth coating and lingering. 



Overall, this beer is pretty amazing. All the flavors I'd expect from the adjuncts.Dec 22, 2021"

Smells of deep roasted malts, big chocolate, coffee, maple aromas with a hint of bourbon at the end of it. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, maple, bourbon but balanced very well. Rich feeling, thick, you can feel the heft on this one but it's really well done. Overall this is an excellent beer, I hope they bring this back into rotation.May 09, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25Picked this up as a single. Did they stop brewing this one? They wanted $8.xx for a bottle!



L: probably should be higher but I don’t see it fundamental difference between this and something 25% of the price. 

S: the best part. Very complex and interesting. The maple syrup and cocoa are strong but, to my nose, there’s a wonderful rye whiskey spice here. 

T: follows the nose to an extent but not as good as I remember. Same stuff happening but kinda stunted. 

F: oh yeah, no doubt this is barrel-aged. Filling, low carbonation, boozy almost chewy. 

O: the 100 rating is insane. I have had far superior beers for less.Apr 24, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75Poured aggressively into a stout glass after a marathon training run on a cold but sunny day. Color is dark brown, nearly black, 1” brown head with fair retention, some lacing.



Nose: Immediate fragrance of maple syrup, bourbon, and dark roast, some chocolate, considerable sweetness.



Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, plenty thick.



Attack: Complex combination of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and maple syrup. There’s a lot going on in this fine brew.



Finish: Some hops but very well balanced. Lingering taste of alcohol.



Overall: This was a near perfect marathon training recovery drink!Feb 05, 2022"

look: 3 | smell: 2 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 2.75Obtained a 4 pack for $35 at my local stout store. Couldn't believe they had it, i haven't seen it anywhere else, so even though there was a steep price to pay i just had to try it. Poured out a deep dark brown with a light tan head that lingered long after i poured it. In fact, several minutes after i poured it there remained a frothy loft of bubbles just waiting for me to taste it. Smell is not too strong. Not strong at all in fact. Very weak. Not what I look for in a beer. I usually want at least some kind of scent, but i've poured this into a snifter and swirled it around a good deal and still receive barely anything. Am i losing my sense of taste or have i just become accustomed to stronger beers? Well whatever nevermind i'll try a sip. A little bit of nuttiness, a little bit of caramel and toffee, a little bit of molasses, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, but it's all just a little bit. i'm not certain what's supposed to be the dominant note here. i don't really get what they're truly going for. Usually there should be at least one taste that's predominant, but i'm getting a flat wash of not really much of anything except muted tones of what it claims to have. Aged on maple syrup it says, bourbon it says, well hell i'm not getting much of either. There is a sweetness to it, but it's kind of a flavorless sweetness. Did i get a bad bottle? How could this be rated a 100? I look for deep, dark, strong, bold flavors and this has none of that. Mouthfeel is light and sparkly, probably the best part about this beer. Overall, i'm rather disappointed. I can't believe i spent so much on this flavorless effort. I've had a LOT of brews that have been barrel aged, flavored with coffee and chocolate and maple syrup, but this just doesn't deliver. What's the hype? I'll stick to Hoppin Frog who knows how to get it right. I thought this would be a smooth slow sipper but i'm tempted now to just slam it, get the buzz, and call it a night. So disappointed.

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.5Bottled 10/9/19. Bottle to tulip glass.



L: Very dark brown, almost black. Small head that settled quickly; very little lacing.

S: Low aroma, mainly of bourbon. The barrel is here but it's more oak than maple syrup. A little roasty, too.

T: Very sweet, but balances really well with the malt and the bourbon heat. I remember this being too much maple when it was new but after two years it's almost perfectly balanced.

F: Thick, a little bitter at the back. Boozy but not overwhelmingly so.

O: Might be the best of the Breakfast Stout variants.Jan 03, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours a clear, golden color, medium carbonation. A silky, frothy foam head. Leaves behind sticky lacing. 



Aroma: A sweet, pungent hoppy aroma. Fragrant floral, citric, piney, and some herbal notes present. 





Taste: A good, complex flavor profile. Starts off with a balanced blend of citrus rind, pine resin and grapefruit, and then evolves into a notable lingering tangy bitterness in the middle with some tropical fruits. All the while, subtle malts in the background compliment the whole thing, keeping it in composition. The bitterness rides all the way through the somewhat boozy finish. 



Overall: This is a unique brew to say the least. Layer after layer, the aroma and flavor complexity played a game of hockey with my senses.Sep 20, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Tasted on tap at Native Son Ale house in Rancho Cucamonga, CA.



L - Served in a clear plastic Solo cup due to the bar’s location inside a giant food court with outdoor patios. Light golden color with a touch of chill haze. Pure white head started out fluffy and a finger thick, but quickly faded to little more than a ring around the glass. Head may have been impeded by the plastic cup.



S - Again the cup may have lessened the impact of the nose, as it was hard for me to get much. Nice DIPA aromas of citrus and pine with some sweet, bready malt at a lower level. Not overly distinctive nose, but hits the right notes for the style. 



T - Explosion of West Coast hops, with orange and grapefruit citrus notes, along with pine resin. Maybe a hint of pineapple. A light touch of bready malt that quickly fades in the surprisingly dry finish. The beer lacks enough malt to begin to balance against the hops, as I normally expect in the style. 



F - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Monstrous hops bitterness level that burns the citrus into your tongue. Alcohol heat is hard to pick out behind the hops burn. Very dry finish that leaves the hops aftertaste to linger.



O - I was very glad to finally try this beer after years of hype but not having any opportunities in Florida or in my travels. Is it a great beer? Certainly. Is it a world’s best, or an aging example? I won’t get into that debate. I can only say that, for my palate and preferences, this lacks in malt character to stand out as an Imperial IPA. To me it is more properly called an assertive West Coast IPA, and a great one, and I’ll leave it at that.Sep 01, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Wow, have seen some sub 4 reviews of Pliny....wawhat??!! This is by far one of the best beers out there. Regardless of your hoppy beer type preference being pale ale, IPA, or stout, this DIPA will knock your socks off both with its wonderful taste as well as its effect. Pop this beer open fresh (I have only had it bottled...not on tap or canned) outta a cold fridge and get your nose on it for some wonderfully floral and hoppy aromas. At 8% this DIPA is strong and one 17.5oz bottle will set most right requiring a brief 20 min interlude before standing up quickly/getting behind the wheel to hop to the next tasting room/bar. If I could keep a constant stock of Pliny the Elder available in my fridge I would, but alas it is a rare find down here in San Diego. Should have bought a case while I had the chance while at the high-end uber boujee Seaside Market in Cardiff-by-the-Sea. Maybe they have some left....hmmmm...I'll be back!Aug 26, 2022"

Left some nice lacing in the glass. Smell was all hops. A lot of tropical and citrus fruit is in the aroma. Taste enters sweet with a healthy dose of grapefruit, orange, mango. Middle has a bit of pithy bitterness and more tropical flavors but its balanced by a nice malt backbone. Finish is balanced with a slight hint of alcohol. Feel is medium bodied, lower carbonation but enough to provide a solid base for the flavor. Overall, well worth the wait for this classic expression. The flavors were bold, bright, and expressive.

look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 | overall: 3Long time coming. I have been wanting to get my hands on this beer for a few years. If you know me, I love imperial stout, barleywine and double ipa. If it's not full bodied then probably not gonna rate very high on my list. This brew poured a very light tan with a thin head. Nose was very happy and floral. Mouthful was very light with little malt backbone. I was dissatisfied with the taste of a beer that is rated 100. Maybe 15 years ago but with the evolution of craft beer I find it hard to fathom this beer in the top 50 all time. I would rate it 3 out of 5. Just like Hopslam this beer is overhyped and in my opinion not worth all the accolades. Of I were to taste it on draft the outcome could be different, but like I said I prefer full bodied brews and lean towards other styles. So take it for what it's worth.

look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5Appearance: Clarity is clear, silky head, laces the glass throughout the session and has a long lasting head retention. Perfect pale/bronze color. 



Aroma: Hop forward aroma as expected, but not deep or complex with a light malty sweetness in the background. 



Mouthfeel: The body is a thin to medium body, solid carbonation that sings on the tongue, small alcohol warmth.



Flavor: Complex hop characteristics, gives small citrus flavor off from hops with some black currant like flavors and a solid touch of pine and a touch of floral/perfumy like flavors, from the bittering to flavoring hop additions. Small sweetness from the malt flavor to act as the backbone. Long lasting hop bitterness sticks with you after each drink that is still pleasant to enjoy.



This is a solid and most importantly classic/quintessential West Coast style IPA and shows exactly the path from the old school IPA 2000s vibes with the heavy magnum bittering. This beer shows the depth of hops from each stage of the beer making process to give deep complexity to the hop flavor.Aug 10, 2022"

Woodbury bar on tap Nonic pint



A- Golden-orange body capped with a 1/2 finger off-white head. Awesome thick lace left on the glass. Retains at a thin foam.



S- Grapefruit and Topical scents with a sugary doughy backbone. Robust and fresh. Leafy hops, tobacco, resin and herbs as it opens up.



T- Great balance of grapefruit hops up font. Doughy and sweet cracker malts in the middle like honey whole wheat. Grapefruit and herbal spicy black pepper hop finish. A little aspirin.



M- medium full body. Crisp. Hoppy bite.



O- Fresh drinkable IPA. No frills or quirky additions. Just a straight up solid IPA. I could see this as a go-to IPA if it was available. Definitely glad I finally got to try this classic brew on the last day of a SF trip.

4.35/5  rDev -6.3%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.25Poured from a 17.25 FL Oz bottle, bottled on 6-14-2022 so a month and 16 days old. Poured into spiegelau IPA glass.



On the pour a white nearly three finger head forms after a minute or two it slightly recedes making more room to pour, and I am able to get the head over the rim over the glass. Head becomes quite rocky but has very good retention. Carbonation after the pour looks quite ligjt and lazy. Body is a slightly dark gold. On the paler side of a lot of IPAs and with a very slight chill haze. Laces very nicely.



Aroma is quite bright with a hit of resinous grapefruit sweet hops. Some malt sweetness comes through, but the hops are very big on this one. A very sweet floral and citric smelling beer. Nothing off and very clean. More juicy than I expected.



Taste is similar to the aroma but a lot of the fruity qualities are traded for a big wave of bitterness that slowly fades leaving a resinous zesty but sweet and malty finish that lingers but is very nicely balanced after the big wave of hops. Despite the abv I can't really detect alcohol as the hops actually cover it up. Despite being super hoppy this isn't a mess and is very drinkable with a nice hop evolution that gives a good balance of bite to flavor.



Feel is soft and dangerously drinkable with a perfectly balanced carbonation bite to softness provided by the head. Honestly this is tasty af and I'm not an ipa guy nobody does everything right and maintains the balance. This feels like a benchmark and I could drink this all summer long if it wasn't 8% and so damn expensive.



Overall this beer is very hyped up. Don't get me wrong it's very good. There's essentially nothing wrong with it, the bitterness isn't cloying, but is pleasantly present, and it's big and hoppy without forgetting its a malt drink. It even looks beautiful. It's the perfect IPA, but everyone is trying to imitate it so unless this is you're whale you probably have a general idea of how this tastes, you've just had a similar but inferior beer. Is it worth the price? Maybe maybe not though. $7.99 for the bottle at a store in Colorado. Maybe I got scammed.Jul 31, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Comes in a crystal clear golden color, with a creamy, marshmallowy bright white head. Incredible retention with sheets of lacing.

The aroma doesn't explode from the glass, but it's nice. Earthy and piney, with pithy grapefruit. Think forest floor, littered with grapefruit peels. Potting soil, pine needles, pine cone, grapefruit peel, a touch of grass, and orange peel.

Juicy yellow grapefruit, and bright fresh white pine hit in equal measure. Grapefruit and orange peels and juice take over and dominate, but earthy pine needles remain in the background. The malt is subtle, biscuity, slightly toasty, offering a slight sweetness but remaining subtle. It finishes clean and crisp, moderately bitter. Hop oils, grapefruit and pine linger on your tongue and make the palate sticky.

Nice medium-plus body, good carbonation, moves quickly and smoothly on the palate but leaves a lasting impression.



This is every bit a world-class WCDIPA. Tastes phenomenal.Jul 30, 2022"

Would you dare poop poo on a Tree House New England style IPA for being stuck in the past? For some reason only pioneer West Coast IPA's get this treatment for their style, never the pioneers of hazy IPA's of the Northeast. This beer is extremely well crafted and balanced, while punching a piney flavor burst to your jaw. Everything about this screams well balanced while adhering to the West Coat style. And whaddya know, this beer invented the damn West Coat Imperial Ipa Style!



I will say, their only competition would be Alvarado atm, along with Cellarmaker.



There's a couple up and comers. Another OG would be Boneyard brewing who took a malt heavy approach for their beers and somehow, they kept their integrity after the buyout and do have the price advantage over Russian River. Bay Area beer heads are blessed with those two and Cellarmaker, BareBottle, Revision, and Field Works, to go along with the San Diego breweries that make their way up there.Jun 24, 2022"

Acquired via trade

Current Rank: #31 on Beer Advocate



Appearance: 5 - blacky black but a bit thin at the edges. The head remains as a thin halo.



Nose: 5 - I'm constantly impressed with AleSmith nailing the ratios. It's perfect stout:barrel:coffee.



Taste: 5 - ditto. Each part complements the other two perfectly. The coffee lingers on the back end very pleasantly.



Mouth: 5 - silky smooth. Slightly thick, but like velvet going down.



Overall: 5 - absolutely lives up to the hype.

Pours a bright yellowish orange, with good carbonation. Sour fruit and funk on the nose.

Nose is strong apricot, minimal funk. Taste follows, strong apricot, minimal funk, strong acidity on the end. Feel is effervescent, medium carb. Overall, it is a great apricot beer!



2020 batch 

Very similar to 2018, I got more fruit on the nose, less on the taste with a lot less acidity, better rounded and get more of the house culture.

look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25On tap at Ansari's in Eagan MN the other day (the 2021version). Was very excited to see this beer on tap, even at the price point ($14.99 for a 4 ounce pour).



The beer poured the expected blackish brown color, with minimal lacing and not much in the way of head retention. Still, I didn't think this was particularly unusual for a ba impy stout. On the nose, I'm picking up dark chocolate, light licorice, some vanilla and a hint of cherry. Not really getting much of any bourbon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this moderately sweet stout, but with a slight roasty component as well. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is pretty long. As others have noted, there's some sort of odd flavor in the finish. It's not bad, just unusual (a slight wet cardboard flavor). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, which I appreciate. 



This is a nice beer no doubt, but the accolades this beer garners is a bit of a head scratcher. Likewise, the price tag for this beer is a puzzler as well. I ordered 3 ba impy stouts at Ansari's, and the Assassin was clearly low man on the totem pole (a ba coconut stout from 608 brewing from Wisconsin was vastly superior to the Assassin). Whatever. Each to their own. This is still a pretty good impy stout, but given the ""value quotient"" for this beer, I'm pretty sure this isn't something I'll ever need to order again.May 21, 2022"

Taste is dominated by woody bourbon notes with some dark roasted malt and black chocolate notes with some vanilla and a rather dry finish.

Mouthfeel: Smooth as a dolphin. Maybe too smooth? I would be happy with more of a carbonation bite. 



Taste: I don't think it's as citrusy as people are saying, but that isn't to say there is no citrus/tropical fruit. Fruity up front then quickly transfers to a puckering bitter floral/piney taste. Almost reminiscent of a west coast at the end if it wasn't for such a creamy mouthfeel. 



Overall: pretty decent. I wouldn't say it's a 100 beer. I think the hype over Tree House might be pushing people too far one way but it's definitely a good beer. It's worth trying, as all beer are.Aug 17, 2022"

A: The beer is a very hazy light gold color, with a large foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick but spotty lace on the glass.



S: The aroma contains strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits, floral and dank hops and light caramelized malts.



T: The taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.



M: Crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.



O: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent 2NEIPA to drink for a very long time.May 30, 2022"

16 fl. oz. can coded ""LETS GO CELTICS! 05/06/22 08:40:04"". Sampled on 05/15/22

$20.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22



Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The head appears to be holding quite well as is always the case with Treehouse beers. The aroma delivers sweetish and bready malt along with notes of passionfruit, nectarine, some mild hop resin, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of passionfruit, pineapple, orange, citrus pith, and a hint of lemon/lime. The malt is basic and sweetish. It's bready, and oat-like. A very firm bitterness makes it's way through all of the sweet malt (it's got to be more bitter but you just can't tell) but there's also a whole lot of acidic ""hop burn"" and it finishes dry with some passionfruit, soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium but feeling a little fuller because of all the extra proteins from the wheat and oats, and the carbonation and hop acidity gives a gentle bristle on the tongue before becoming smoother. The head has held up really well and it's left some beautiful lace all around the glass. I'm quite pleased with Very Green and feel that it's actually better than Green but that's just my opinion. Regardles, it remains a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

Poured into my Precious Things Teku (my one and only Teku), this was an opaque yellow-orange color, with a good sized & creamy looking off-white head. Lots of lace.



Nose is of tropical and citrus fruits. Initially just sweet fruit scent, as it warms a more bitter, pithy aroma seeps into the background.



More complex than the nose lets on, although the beginning is straightforward tropical fruits and Mandarin oranges, Midway through there's a more pithy, bitter happiness. The level of bitterness is just right to add a shade of complexity to things without clashing with what came before. Things finish off smoothly, with a slightly dry bitter zap to the palate.



Medium bodied, with a mouth feel that's a bit creamy.



Really, really dug this. Really regretting only having one can. Thank you so much for this, Bill!Apr 29, 2022"

Holy. Fucking. Hell. I’m finally having this beer, and my lucky review #777. This beer is the result of my first beer trade ever, thanks to the incredible fo5s. Much appreciated bro, I’ve had this marked as a want on here for just about 3 years. This is the #1 fruit Lambic, and has been for quite some time. It currently sits at #17 overall, and I can’t think of a better beer for my personal #777 as a very highly regarded apricot Lambic. I actually have a few trades going for different vintages of this, with updated reviews to come. Alright, I know that was a lot of numbers, let’s just get into it now



Pours an opaque pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing



This smells absolutely heavenly. Even with over a year of age on it the fruit hasn't faded like some say that it has. I'm assuming it's more prominent in a fresher batch, but it's wonderful here too. I'm picking up on aromas of jammy dried apricot, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, aged leather, white grape, earthy wheat, doughy malt, light pepper, and lemon rind



This is unreal in taste as well, and not nearly as sharply sour as the aroma would suggest. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting juicy apricot, underripe peach, wheat bread, straw, pear juice, lemon rind, and light oak. The swallow brings notes of jammy dried apricot, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, peach rings, lemon rind, crackery malt, lime juice, and old leather



A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp and tart beer. Finishes mostly dry but leaves a slight film behind on the tongue from the residual sugars



I honestly think this might be the one of the best beers I've ever had. Everything is so nuanced but flavorful at the same time. The 6% abv keeps it beyond drinkable, almost crushable, but that is not what I wanna do with this beer. I'm gonna cherish every last drop of this one. With the others I get, I'll see how it develops over time. Another massive shoutout to fo5s for this one. Cheers BA!Sep 14, 2021"

My first foray into the Julius “family” was King Julius a couple hours ago, and after pouring this guy, I see - and smell - a lot of similarities. The regular version appears to be slightly paler than the double version, and the head dissipated more quickly as well.



The nose on this however is hitting me more in the face than “King.” I’m getting wafts of canteloupe, mango and orange, and it’s very citrus-forward. Smells fantastic.



The taste is very similar as well, although this tastes slightly more malty, and the feel is definitely nowhere near as chewy. I get much more melon lingering after the sip has faded, as well.



I sipped on King Julius for more than an hour, but I feel like I would crush the regular version all day. Great beer.Jul 31, 2022"

16 fl. oz. can coded ""WARM WEATHER UPON US 05/11/22 07:57:27"". Sampled on 05/13/22

$15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22



Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a very cloudy brass-orange body beneath a finger's width of pillowy off-white foam. The aroma is not as bright as I thought it would be having just sampled a Juli-ish, which is their lower gravity/alcohol version of this. I'm getting some sweetish malt that's grainy but not overly so as I can smell the oats as well. It's fruity with soft orange and peach. The flavor is bright, floral, citrusy, and otherwise fruity. I'm getting orange, mango, melon, peach, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine, but not as much as I found in the Juli-ish. I guess the little bit of extra malt here is covering it up. I will say that this is much better balanced and rounded though. It's got a median bitterness that keeps it in check across the palate and then leads to a dry finish. I should also note that I found a lot of ""hop bite"" in the smaller beer, but not as much here; that made it seem drier than this. There's not a lot of fruit lingering, but there is some, and it's a touch mineralish. Yeah, this is really nicely balanced. I could drink at least 4 of these in a row. How strong is it? Ahh, just 6.8%? Make that 6 in a row. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. Based on what I'd heard of this beer I was expecting a true juice bomb that tasted like orange juice but that's not the case, this is so creamy and smooth that it comes across like an orange-creamsicle.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Hazy body, orange and peach toned; huge head, rocky and white; sticky globs of foam cling to the glass. Outstanding citrus smell; orange and tangerine; oats and other cereal grains. Complex and varied flavors; toasted grain; oats; bread crust; citrus pith; bold bitterness with a touch of phenol expression; moderate alcohol note. Heavy body; velvety; alcohol warmth and dryness



I've been curious about this popular and highly rated beer, and I'm glad my curiosity has been satisfied. It certainly earns its reputation for greatness. It exudes eye appeal, an alluring nose; balanced flavors with fine depth, and gently caresses the palate with a soft, warm dryness. A must-try beer.

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.756 weeks old. Can to pint glass.



Look: Pours a hazy orange with a white foamy head that leaves a bit of retention. No floaters.



Smell: Ripe orange and tangerine. Hints of grapefruit.



Taste: Orange, tangerine, grapefruit and peach. Medium sweetness. Slightly bitter and zesty.



Feel: Full and juicy. Nicely balanced with a zesty punch. Medium carbonation. 



Overall: Probably the quintessential Tree House beer with a clear focus on orange citrus fruits. Not overly complex but outstanding in all its qualities. Perfectly executed. Very full and aromatic despite its relatively low ABV of 6.8.Feb 19, 2022"

Nose is moderate resinous hop and pine, light citrus juice, and grain. Found that it really needed to warm up before fruitier notes came out - mango, passionfruit, general sticky tropical fruit. Taste is spicy black and white pepper, grapefruit juice and peel, underripe orange, grassy hop, some hop burn. Mouthfeel is full with prickly carbonation, softer as it warms, dry on the finish, and some alcohol heat as well.Feb 19, 2022"

8.2% New England style IPA by Treehouse



Poured into a tulip glass today from a pint can dated 7-12. 



The body pours a dark pineapple yellow with a fluffy head. Very good lacing throughout the tasting. 



Magnificent aroma. Pineapple, Orange, passion fruit, lemon notes and a dankness provide a pleasurable experience. This aroma is the feature of the NE style that I like most. Use a tulip glass and enjoy the aroma throughout. 



The taste begins with a slight bitterness that quickly dissipated into a light dankness. Easy finish as the light bitterness reappears. Super easy drinking. 



Mouthfeel is good, soft but not oat soft.Jul 23, 2022"

Smell - The nose was clean and distinct like orange soda. 



Taste - As is often the case with Tree House, there was a strong orange presence. The profile was also quite green and dank like weed. Notes of melon and guava followed. There were notes of pepper/spice toward the back. 



Mouthfeel - The beer had a huge body, yet still had carbonation.

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Tree House Brewing Co. ""Juice Machine""

16 fl. oz. can coded ""BE KIND 04/21/22 06:58:17"" and sampled on 05/20/22



Notes via stream of consciousness: Juice Machine is a double NEIPA at 8.2% ABV, It's poured a murky orange and gold body beneath a two finger thick head of slightly yellowed off-white foam. The aroma suggests orange, mango, papaya, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is fuller, as usual, and offers up everything found in the nose along with additional notes of peach, some floral character, passionfruit, spiciness, a little bit of melon, zest of lime, some hop resins, and a touch of mint. The malt is sweetish and bready. A median bitterness balances it and it finishes dry with some hop resins and spiciness lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a lot of extra proteins but also with a little bit of zing from the acidic ""hop burn"". As usual for Treehouse the head has held up really well and there's a great amount of fancy lacing throughout the entire glass. I don't know if that's because of all the extra proteins or how carefully they're processing their beers (probably both) but they always have great head retention and lacing. This is my third can of Juice Machine and I've blown through them fairly quickly because although it's full of flavor and ""dank"", it's not as ""dank"" or intense as some of their other beers. They make a few NEIPAs that are even more accessible, and this is pretty complex so I'd put this somewhere in the middle range of what they do.

Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated, but not as pillowy as Green/Alter Ego/certain other single NEIPAs from TH. Just a hint of booziness.

4.71/5  rDev +0.6%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Pours a rich dark brown color that is impenetrable by light and features a creamy mocha colored head that lingers a bit before dissipating to allow you to focus on the beautiful beer in your glass and the aromas drawing you closer.



And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance. I am literally drooling.



The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV).



The mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily, as expected. I sat on this a bit, and it was more than worth the wait. Truly a world class English barleywine.Sep 04, 2022"

4.7/5  rDev +0.4%
look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Pours a dark burgundy that reveals a remarkably clear transparency when held directly against a light. If not held against a light, or if poured in a dark room, the beer looks black. Moderately heavy oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl, foreshadowing a heavy, hearty beer. Head is two and a half fingers of khaki foam.



Aroma is raisins, fig, toffee, molasses, and dark fruits mashed together with leathery, spicy bourbon. Barrel adds additional char and heat, which is smoothed out well by hearty caramel, toasty, and bready malts. That dark fruit character really starts to swell up and become a much more major player in the aroma as the beer warms.



Flavor profile is fig, raisins, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, and hearty dark fruits. Grassy hops add some resinous hop presence, which introduces some pleasant variation to the profile that is not a sugary note, heavy malt, or bourbon. Bourbon is present throughout, but becomes much more present on the back half of the flavor profile, building up heat and complexity akin to the way a snowball builds rolling down a hill. Despite that build up, it never runs away with heat. Underneath it all is strong caramel, bready, and toasty malts. 



Mouth feel is thick with a still effervescence, offering up some light bubbles at the start before smoothing out at the mid-way point. A very light silt adds some further texture, but really, it's smooth. The texture matches, both, the aging process output, and alcohol, suggesting this beer has been slowly pressed flat by the act of time and heavy alcohol. 



Overall, a remarkable beer that pairs bourbon barrel complexity over a resounding barleywine. Regardless of notes, it's a remarkable beer for sipping, offering complexity and depth at every corner and crevice. 



Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can. Canned June 29, 2021. 15% ABV. 



For kicks, this was served side-by-side with Piggyback 6yr Rye aged in V.S.O.J. barrels. This is a sample from barrel #1. A few notes: Dark coloration, with moderate oily legs after a swirl. Spicy rye on the cusp of the nose, with heavy barrel leading way to floral and mild bourbon and dark fruits behind. Complexity is dense, mixing in a little cake at the finish. Flavor profile brings a more mild profile, building spicy rye over oak, lemon zest, floral and mild dark fruits and bourbon. Spice simmers on the back of the palate long after a sip, emphasizing the rye base. Really smooth, with a crescendo from start to finish that resembles a wheelchair ramp - a linear rise from start to finish.



Served neat in a Glencairn glass.Apr 23, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75I received a can of this famous Barleywine from @fbarber in the NBS BIF #14. Can dated 6/29/2021. Poured into a Revolution Deep Wood Series glass also received from Mr. Barber. It pours a deep cola color with a fizzy, light khaki-colored head that dissipated quickly. It boasts a great Barleywine smell with toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, tobacco smoke, oak, and subtle but discernible bourbon. The taste is ridiculous! It's particularly fruity with lots of raisin, plum, and fig, along with loads of brown sugar and toffee, oaky char, tobacco, and a strong, hot bourbon presence. There is little bitterness. The tastes really pop; it's incredibly flavorful. Its mouthfeel is rich and creamy with appropriate and pleasant carbonation, and there's no escaping the 15% ABV; you can feel the alcohol burn. Overall, V.S.O.J is simply exquisite; one of the best English Barleywines I've had the pleasure to drink.Jan 08, 2022"

Poured dark reddish brown with minimal head that dissipated quickly, no discernible foam either, but continuous bubbles appear from the depths of the glass.

The aroma was bourbon and malts, taste is almost sweet but isn’t, not sure how that happens. Figs, raisins, plums all swirling in the bourbon.

The taste rather follows, just more intense, amazing flavors and the 15% ABV is well hidden. Really, really good.

The feel is viscous enough to carry the weight of the flavors without being cloying. Great sipper!

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Appearance - The beer poured a golden copper color with a small collection of bubbles topping the poor.



Smell - The nose was sweet. Notes of caramel and earthy malts came before the booze. 



Taste - Oh my! Caramel lead the way, followed by leather and mild bourbon. The booze was so perfectly balanced that it took nothing away from the base beer. This is an example of a beer that slept well in barrels. The profile was modestly warming but certainly did not burn.



Mouthfeel - The body was thick but not cloying. It lingered just long enough to have me wanting more. 



Overall - This was a fantastic beer.Dec 11, 2021"

Nose is a big orange juice bomb with a hint of pith and herbal notes. Taste consistent with nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an easy, even carbonation.

L: Pours an opaque yellow gold with a one-finger head that quickly thins to a film on top but creates a thick ring around the glass. Beautiful lacing, with big stripes circling the glass.



S: Aromas of mango and peach jump out of the pour.



T: More peach and mango up front, transitioning to more general citrus/tropical in the middle. Finishes with an exceptional dry bitterness that is just right.



F: The classic Tree House soft mouthfeel is on display here, with just enough prickliness at the end to keep the tastebuds alert.



O: A magnificent example of what a NEDIPA can be. An aroma that recalls the finest fruit produce at the farmer's market. A taste that's juicy without being thick or sweet. A feel that's pillowy but keeps you awake. It's all here.Aug 27, 2022"

Canned: Aug-10-2022



Pours like they all do... Very nice, glowing orange haziness with a creamy cap that sticks around till the end. Aroma and flavor are a complex, layered mixture of tropical and non-tropical fruits and different ""green"" characters just like the OG Green (probably my favorite beer, and definitely my favorite NEIPA) but turned up a bit. This does not drink like a gimmick. Nose is still a little rough around the edges. But is a melange of sticky, resinous fruit. The flavor is grapefruit oleo, underripe guava, green mango, pine sap. It is so wonderfully sappy-yet-sweet and hop layered/laden. It reminds me of the first time I had Heady Topper*. Morning dew in the Rockies at the break of day after a late night around the campfire. Hot dogs. America. Fuck. So good.

Truly loverly.



*-Sweet Jesus, is this an old school/throwback/nostalgia NNEEIIPPAA? on est-tu rendus là?



Tip of my hat to you, K-Cizzle. Looking forward to seeing how this one ages lol

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5I have not rated a beer in awhile, but this one deserves the effort. For a second I thought I had Very Green in two different labels and wondered why this one tasted so much better. I brought back a couple of cases from my camping trip of all sorts of shades of Green. The sweet floral aroma out of the can translated right into the flavor and held strong the whole way through to the end of the can. That is rare. The malt backbone was just strong enough to hold it all together without getting in the way. Wow! I wish I had more.



One more note: This tasting was after the beer was in the can for 1 1/2 months.Jul 21, 2022"

There’s dank citrus flavors up front on taste, but it’s that passion fruit/mango/pineapple trifecta that makes this beer for me, and the full, creamy mouthfeel that accompanies the bit of hop bite at the back end is just the cherry on top of this excellent beer.Jun 25, 2022"

Pours a turbid, mango purée-esque body topped with multiple fingers of rich, fluffy, slightly off-white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of creamy cap, a large, frothy collar, and thin, soapy curtains of webby/spotty lacing draping down the entirety of the walls of the glass.



Aromas of dank peppermint beneath layers of juicy pineapple and mango slices dominant, with dense undertones of bubblegum yeast accented by papaya as a subtle, bready malt welcomes an earthy, catty stank to the back end of the bouquet.



Taste highlights orange contrasted by sweeter peach upfront, progressively dank and overripe into musty passionfruit and guava over the mid-palate as a catty dank proceeds into bready malt easing into mossy undertones on the finish.



Mouthfeel offers a medium-full body and a moderate carbonation, rounded and fluffy to a peak of creamy overtones and contrasting juicy, boggy resins; a hop twang emerging in the back end guides to a refined, earthy grit marking the finish.



Myriad juicy fruits and boggy hops bring an onslaught of lush, full-flavored character within an overtly resinous containment; supremely, comprehensively expressive, this is an immense display of hop variation from Tree House at its peak.Jun 18, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Born 25 July, 2017. 12.9% ABV.

Top popped (53 degrees) with a whimpering sigh, got a nice coffee aroma right away. Almost zero head at all made for a full pour into my 12oz Avery Brewing snifter.

Bourbon and espresso coffee share the nose space. 

The first taste matches the nose. Chewing on it a little reveals notes of fine cacao, bit of vanilla, faint oak barrel, a dark fruit I can’t quite put a finger on and a welcoming heat. 

Mouthfeel is decadant! Little bit of carbonation lightened the usual BCBS heaviness. 

Not overly syrupy too! Yay!

Overall - a remarkably smooth and excellent treat that stood up to 5 years of temperature controlled storage.

look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 42014 Vintage



Appearance: Black with a small, dark, beige head that quickly faded. Age probably took a big hit on the head size.



Smell: Fairly prominent bourbon aromas and moderate coffee aromas. Not bad, but again age is a factor here as well as the appearance.



Taste: Bourbon notes, prominent coffee notes, mild brown sugar notes, and mild tannic oak notes. The coffee comes off a touch bitter but considering the age of the beer it's not bad and provides a nice counter to the bourbon notes.



Mouth-feel: Mediuml-bodied with a fairly low level of carbonation. Not a bad mouthfeel but age is a factor.



Overall: While the beer wasn't bad, I get the feeling I'm only getting a glimpse of how good the beer was fresh. hopefully it's rebrewed and I can get my hands on a fresh one.Mar 06, 2022"

12.6% ABV 



The beer is listed as “Stout – American Imperial” on BA. 



The beer was removed from a 40ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 years. Beer poured into 2012 BCBS snifter. 



First Impression: Pours dark, thinner than BCBS. 4.5 



Appearance: Standard Bourbon County. An aggressive pour years only a small amount of khaki head that fades quickly, leaving only a small ring around the glass. 4.25



Smell: Coffee up front. Mostly this cold-brew smelling with a hint of grounds and also the dread ‘pepper’. Weak barrel on the nose. 4.25



Taste: 2014 and earlier BCBCS is what all coffee stouts should be judged on for me. As the kids say, ‘it fucks’. And after this many years, to still say that? Come on. Taste starts with the coffee, shifts to bourbon, pulls in some chocolate fudge brownies, shifts back to bourbon, finishes on coffee, and then a slow finish lasts for longer than most BA stouts, let alone BA coffee stouts. Impressive for 12.5% abv. 4.70



Mouthfeel: Coffee stouts are always thinner than their regular counterparts. They just are. While this is clearly thinner than the regular, not appreciably so. For judging this against other coffee stouts, this is still upper echelon. 4.75



Overall: This is a great beer, and I’m jamming on this. I debated about whether to have this tonight, because I have to get up in 4.5 hours to hit the BCBS release. Well, I’m glad I did, but only because I chose to drink this tonight. It’s really fantastic. It’s incredible how well this has held up. I did have this a few years back (just once), and while it was great, I don’t remember enjoying it quite this much. This is just singing tonight. It’s everything that I want. And the finish just keeps going. I’m in heaven. All this said – could it be better? Of course. I’d love to have even more barrel. I’d love to see how this shined at 15%. But for what it is, and compared to others, this is Heaven. 4.65

look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Bottled 7/25/17, cracking this open just over 4 years later



Oh boy, we have quite the whale here. From what I've heard, the coffee BCBS is one of the most sought after variants, and 2017 is unfortunately the last vintage. I never really expected to see it on a shelf anywhere. However, when visiting DC this past weekend, I decided to pop in a liquor store to search for some of the Dogfish Head spirits, since we don't get those up here in Mass. Well, I found their whiskey and was happy, but decided to check out the beer selection. This one was staring at me and I immediately snatched it without looking at the price tag. Worth it? Let's find out



Pours a velvety black with a finger of dark tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing but very strong legs



This is wonderfully balanced between roasty and sweet in the nose, like a decadent coffee drink mixed to perfection. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy caramel, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla creme, ripe fig, smooth oak, and just the slightest hint of sweet blueberry



The fact that this has such a strong coffee presence after 4 years is very impressive. Many of these beers tend to fall off in flavor pretty quick, but it is beautifully preserved here, despite not being full force. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting creamy vanilla, lightly spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, medium acidic coffee, and light grape. The swallow brings notes of decadent milk chocolate, oily espresso beans, burnt toast, a touch of that vegetal green pepper character others have complained about in older bottles, and earthy oaked bourbon on the aftertaste



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and viscous beer. Finishes mostly dry from the bourbon heat



This beer is awesome! It doesn't quite crack my top 10 though I suspect it might if fresher. Regardless, I'm very happy to have tried this one, and here's to hoping they bring it back next year!Aug 11, 2021"

L: Deep black with a slight twinge of brown



A: The winner in my opinion. Bakers chocolate and coffee all the way.



T: Do not drink this beer cold, severely underwhelming. Once it warms there is a strong chocolate syrupy goodness up front followed by a slight sweetened Cuban coffee. While I assume the coffee has dropped off some, still provides a strong aftertaste which makes it more enjoyable. 



M: It’s bourbon county. Always proper almost syrup like.



O: While a damn good beer, I think the hype train has won with the coffee BCBS. I have not had a lot of them, but I prefer the regular. Maybe I’m in the minority here. Still great though.Jan 23, 2021"

Appearance: Pours impenetrable dark brown with no head at all, leaving a slight sediment behind in the bottle. 



Smell: Very rich coffee and bourbon, a bit of chocolate. No green pepper.



Taste: Phenomenally smooth and deep. Starts with bourbon, shifts to dark, acidic coffee grinds, finishes with a delightful burnt bread roast. My only demerit is that I find the bourbon ever so slightly too dominant on some finishes.



Feel: Full-bodied but not too heavy, with light carbonation. Bit of alcohol on the finish, but not too much.



Overall: It's a huge beer, really well put-together. It's a bourbon-lover's coffee stout, with a very prominent bourbon character that somehow still doesn't mask the big coffee base.Dec 20, 2020"

look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.252013 Vintage - Los Inmortales Coffee 



335ml bottle - lightly chilled, poured into a snifter.



Appearance: Pours a coal-black hue - slightly thin, with a deep reddish-mahogany ring around the top edge. Zero head, zero foam, zero collar. Just sits like liquorice-coloured liquid in the glass. Lifeless.



Nose: Surpriseingly, the coffee is still here - and quite strong. The coffee is deep, dark, roasty and pungent, with an almost stale quality to it - like a gas station coffee maker that hasn't been emptied or cleaned in a day. It almost smells sticky and concentrated, very much like Kaluha. Zero green pepper. There's some deep roast beneath the coffee, along with a bit of an ashen/smoky note. Some tangy dark fruit peeks through, as well as some bourbon, and if you really dig deep, some vanilla, oak, and baker's chocolate emerge. Not much warmth. Coffee dominates.



Palate: This 7 year old stout greets the palate fairly sweet, with some rich chocolate fudge, brownie batter, vanilla, bourbon, and oak, before an intense coffee presence explodes and takes the lead. It's a miracle there's still so much coffee in here. The coffee is sweet, black, roasty, with some fresh whole bean notes. Saturated, almost like coffee liqueur, and then finally showing some of that stale back coffee character. A whisper of tangy dark fruit pokes out, before some coffee bean bitterness begins to show, quickly compounded by blackened malt bitterness, drying this out very quickly and fully. Some more subtle bourbon, followed by some less subtle barrel reappear, and the finish approaches, bringing sticky black coffee, roasty beans, bitter malt roast, pure cacao, charred malt, and spicy charred oak. No lingering sweetness.



Mouthfeel/Body: Admittedly, I expected this to be thin, given its age, but surprisingly, it's actually packing some nice heft when chilled. It isn't luscious or chewy, but before it warms, it does have some nice viscosity, though it does thin out as it warms. Effervescence is extremely low - not still, and there is some subtle fuzz in there, but like a cup of soda the morning after you poured it. Quite sticky around the lips, but almost fully dries out in the finish with all that roast.



Overall: This is a difficult one to rate. Is it fair to formally review and rate a 7 year old coffee stout that I've never had? It may actually not be. I'll never know how this was when fresh, but even now, I'd say this is a perfectly respectable barrel-aged coffee stout. Strong coffee presence, no green pepper notes, essentially no oxidation, and maybe just a hint of staleness to the coffee. The bourbon and barrel are subdued, and the effervescence is lacking, but as-is, this is still a great coffee stout. The fact that it has held up so well is definitely a testimony to the early-mid BCBS era. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is the most you could ask for in a 7 year old coffee stout. I have to wonder if the 2013 was particularly coffee-forward, because apparently less ancient bottles have already lost their beans. Certainly not the case here, but I wouldn't hold onto one any longer than this. Gracefully aged.Nov 29, 2020"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Ok this beer is over Ten Years old and is the Black Cat Expresso version. Was bottled on 03/26/10 - 2208 and It has been cellared in a wine fridge for the whole time at 14 degrees Celcius.



A - well its damn dark Black oily colour with a dark beige head that dies quickly.

S - Very large aromas of old potted coffee and smoley dark vanilla.

T - Wow. Massive. So up fron some milky latte flavours that pretty soon get drowned out by massive expresso dark coffee. The finish is smokey rolled tobacco before a nice sweet finish ensues that is made up of vanilla and caramel. Its massive !

M - Deep deep body with light to medium carbonation

O - Huge beer that is very bold is every sense. It has aged so very well, the only dissapointment is that it didnt smoothen out more as it packs such a punch. This beer is by no means past its best and will go into my Hall of FameJul 17, 2020"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25A: The emergence is dense on lucidity with a materialization that ensues oily margins. Similarly, a visibility on fingers thru a firewater viscosity, at a state where the collar is annulled, if tolerant on time. The pour is deep on mahogany, and transcendent on ruby highlights, while the neck transcribes a copper to chestnut tone. Correspondingly, a thinning out on retention to the hour, which terminates lace delicately, before that annulled header addressed above



S: The cask recitals circumference the subtle (earthy) hop effects, which quarter the esters, while building a strong dexterity around sweet – bready – malt. An inclination on dark fruit that ranges to elderberries, when exhibiting dated prunes amongst raisins. Sequentially, an armored disposition on Crème caramel that’s been slightly browned to aptness, before taxing in a Mackintosh bar. The inclining humidity brawns a treacliness over a Black Forest Chocotorta & liquored truffles, while pitting leathery advances against brown sugar tobacco. Synchronously, a hop bite to softly cuddle malts candied advances on creamed variations, when sylvan elements develop upon the tarry dried fruit inclinations. With this in mind, a bittering – woodsy – expansion that’s deepening on pine resin around timberlands, yet a facilitating aid to not overextend the greenery virulence. Moreover, a step that nears Goobers with a charred following on walnuts, besides stale cherry bitters to coriaceous stipulations. Oxidation is lightly pressed against the late solvent esters that work to benefit the movement, by suggesting a Pedro Ximénez cleverness, while barreling the oak staves at length



T: Bourbon continually pillars the complexity with a warming – humid – torridness on malt, as hops lightly frame a woodsy path. The elements touch on a caramelized fig custard, while parading crystallized stone fruit in a molasses – marshmallow – soufflé. Secondly, a posturing sweetness to neighbor an unwanted cloyingness in balminess; however, a position that’s impeccably groomed to cloak heat. In sequence, a spice to fruit component that prompts Ethyl Caproate under the residual malt pleasantness. There is an ongoing sentience over the varying cask proportions, which are competently equipped to gamble on the sustained aeriation. Thusly, meandering polymers to further provoke/strengthen vanillin aside honeyed spices, while continuing to calibrate the oak lactones. The barrel presence continues on to address almonds with lightly shredded coconut, as a hard Skor emanates against fudge. In addition, liquored raisins applied to charring, when shriveled cherries pass cordials & cola taffy, once hops attune that backwoods kick to face grape – brandy – bugs. A measure that becomes thirsting of tannin stipulations in the patient exertions, as dried leaves spread from a nearby – progressive – ruin 



M: Sidesteps under-attenuation in the inclusive duty, of not overwhelming the rich records. Nonetheless, the approach is sweet with a chewy dexterity and a warming sensation, while carbonation is handled in a judicious manner. An approach that does not burn or madden the slick feel, as longevity offers a calm smoothness, in the act of intellectualizing a system over the dry (oak) tannin mannerisms 



O: A hop bill that’s cautiously tempered against a glucose powerhouse, which bypasses the aggressiveness on bite, while still prominent to ally the esters. They offer a balance to the finer points on wood amid the several transfers, as malt sweetens the complexity chronologically, in anticipation of the craftily dry hooks. An onset that’s censoring on depth with a tough buildout; albeit, an advantageous/more beneficial buildout, if given the patience to draw out timeJun 29, 2022"

Taste...absolute explosion of mango, pineapple, melon, green grass reminding me of very green with the Haze impact. 

a bittering dry requiring constant sips. 

Feel...A pillow lake with lily pads of foam and lacing. A quality they reserve for flavorful and mouth covering enjoyment

Overall...I mean everyone has references and I have only had 4 of these incredible beers but the willingness to have again is overbearing .HaHa. Any chance you can get these I would make the move.

Poured into oversized snifter. Completely opaque Hazy darkish yellow. Head settles to sticky lace that coats glass. Tropical notes on the nose, sweet and cracker in the background. Starfruit, citrus, slight dank but more clean. Taste is same, fruity, papaya citrus with nice hop bitterness at the end. Probably overused, but “pillowy” is the only way to describe the feel.

L: Pours an opaque gold with a thick big-bubbled head that stays a while. Irregular but pretty lacing.



S: Aromas of peach, strawberry, guava, lemon and tangerine. Quite a medley.



T: Citrus up front, followed by peach and strawberry. Finishes dry and slightly bitter with some dankness. Very little heat for the ABV.



F: A bit pricklier mouthfeel than is normal for Tree House. Medium carbonation.



O: Very enjoyable. The taste and aroma aren't quite as memorable as the initial appearance, but still a fantastic beer. Outstanding melding of peach/strawberry with citrus.Aug 25, 2022"

""Long days and pleasant nights"" on the date code



Lovely look as per usual. Glowing gold, hazy, ok covering of creamy white head that leaves swooping lacing. The aroma is dank and earthy compared to what I was expecting, with some stonefruit and clementine sweetness underneath. Perhaps a tiny bit faded, but I might be having an off day. Delicious and enticing regardless. The flavor is (as expected) a barrage of peaches, citrus (sweet not tart or bitter) and weedy hop funk. There is definitely more to it but on the whole it is a balance between peachy sweetness, canteloup, clementine and the more resinous (but not sappy) character of the hops. Mouthfeel is spot on as usual, creamy, round and filling while also refreshing. Really nice beer. I think it was Haze that I once described as a sweaty hippie taking a nap in the shade after a day of harvesting peaches. Well in this case the hippie is also burning one and we are smelling his feet after stomping up some overripe peaches to make wine. Or something like that I have no idea...

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.5Sampling a cellar temp bottle poured into my snifter. Received in part of my winnings for NFL BIF 33. This is a 2019 vintage with 13.55% ABV

The beer pours a black coffee color with a dense creamy beige head of 1 cm. This foam fades to a thick edge layer that creates some scattered lacing on swirls and sips.

Aroma is dark fudge, chocolate, bourbon, some vanilla notes and a little fusol alcohol. No hop presence on this aroma.

First sip is lighter body than I expected and smooth slightly creamy texture. Carbonation is soft and gentle and rolls easily across my palate. Easy drinking for a big boozy beer.

Flavor is sweet fudge and chocolate with hints of toffee and brown sugar. I also get bourbon and some vanilla and black peppery spicy heat on the finish. Again hops dont show up anywhere in this brew.

Im glad to have tried this one and like the flavor and aroma, I do think the beer could have a thicker body but that is just me. WOrth grabbing a bottle.Sep 03, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75Serving: 1 Pt. 0.9 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. This is the 2019 edition, so a little age on it. Sorry, it's all I could find! The bottle has 2 check boxes though, one for ""drink fresh"" and one for ""cellar and save"" and the latter is checked. So I'm at least following the rules.



A: Pours super dark and thick, motor-oil like. Nice lacing up the glass. Minimal off-white head that fades quickly.



S: Huge vanilla up front. It's like extract, maybe vanilla coffee creamer. Super on the nose, with a little bourbon note behind it. 



T: Again, vanilla is the centerpiece. It's a real sweet vanilla note here, I know it's not extract, but it's so concentrated and strong. Bourbon there on the finish, really a second player to the vanilla. 



M: This is where this beer really excels. Nice, full mouthfeel. Very balanced. The vanilla is huge, but so is the bourbon. Feels like everything is in HD. Way chewier and thick than some of the more recent BCBS beers I've had.



O: Okay, well. This is very good. I'll start by saying I am not familiar with BL at all. I always noticed FO at the top of the 250 list, but it was so out of reach, I didn't think much of it. Was very fortunate to take a vacation to SF recently and a shop still had some '19 bottles left. Seems like the big comparison point with this beer is BCBVS, which I can totally see. I haven't had that beer in some time, so this isn't a 1:1. But I'll say just from memory that this beer is every bit as good, if not better. My initial impression is that I like the mouthfeel and balance of this beer more. But I do feel the vanilla flavor of BCBVS might be a tough better. This is really strong and vanilla forward, and it's a really sweet and pastry-like vanilla. Not that I want it subdued in any way, but BCBVS has it reeled in and maybe a little more natural-tasting. I really feel like I'm splitting hairs here. At the end of the day, it's huge props to BL for making a really good, chewy, balanced, BA stout. Oh, and I think the age may have even helped this beer. I get no sense of oxidation or fading of flavor. Again, the vanilla is huge on this.



Recommendation: I think this beer deserves its ranking and reputation. Must try for any BA stout fan.May 07, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5The beers pours the expected blackish brown color with minimal lacing and fair at best head retention. This beer has the look of a beer that has seen some pretty significant barrel aging (though it's not overly viscous). On the nose I get dark chocolate and vanilla, with underlying bourbon and light licorice. It's nice but I was expecting a more robust aroma profile. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet stout, but with a much greater level of intensity. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, moderately sweet finish. Carbonation seemed to be on the low side, which I tend to think works well with rich, BA impy stouts (like this one). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell it's up there a bit. Even so, there's no way I would guess an abv. in the 14% range. 



This is a very nice BA impy stout, no doubt, though I guess I was expecting a bit more complexity. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I'm not sure it's a beer I'd go out of my way to find. Still a very solid beer...Apr 18, 2022"

Nose of fig, big thread of booze, some barrel, dark rock candy, espresso grounds and a big vanilla hit.

Fig jam, pastel de nata-ish vanilla pastry tart, root beer, bourbon, ash - but also rum-soaked chocolate cake - but also a ton of booze-soaked dried fruit - with a clean, char-less, roast finish. 

Rich, full, chewy, round, dead smooth and NO BURN



4 4.5 4.75 4.5 4.5



Looks lethal and the nose goes as deep as you want it to. I could sniff this all day; there’s dark rye bread, beef jerky, baker’s chocolate…

That flavor, though. It tastes like a pastry - fig, vanilla, caramel, flaky shell - that doesn’t actually exist. But then it’s also cake! Steph sez: “It’s like they crashed a full bakery into the bottle.”

4-way mud wrestling match between all the vanilla (both bean + barrel, yet without any booze from the latter), sugar, dark fruit, and roasty notes. Everyone takes a turn without taking over. 

It’s a perfect example of barrel aging, it’s savoury, it’s dessert - walks a razor’s edge. How is it so cakey without being that sweet? How does it tame the sweet without being charred or boozy? Not hot, ashy, cloying, sugary… the execution is just baffling + masterful. 





All the hype is true. 2010 Vanilla BCBS is the only thing that comes close. Fantastic.Mar 04, 2022"

4.63/5  rDev -1.1%
look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Pours pitch black, completely opaque and shiny. It appears thick and viscous. Thin, weakish, velvety mocha colored head fleetingly appears on the beer. 



The aroma has notes of vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate, caramelized brown sugar, brownie batter, oak, and some light smoke and dark fruit notes. The vanilla however is the show here - its absolutely dominated by the vanilla and its lovely.



Taste follows the nose with notes of roasted malts, dark fruits, vanilla, sweet cream, bourbon, wet oak, vanilla, chocolate and yea, vanilla. If you like your vanilla stout to avoid subtly this is perfect. Its sweet, but dances up to the cloying line without going over. The barrel aging is nicely balanced. There is a light smokiness that I occasionally get, but I suspect that is the influence of the bourbon. 



Feel is thick, fuller bodied, smooth and viscous. Mild, soft carbonation, but it does not come across as under carbonated.



Overall this is absolutely delicious - an absolutely outstanding use of vanilla in a barrel aged stout.Nov 20, 2021"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 52018 bottle Poured cold, hard to a tulip. Jet black, no floaters. No head at all…starts to bubble for a ring, then peters out. Nose is a sort of light smoked cherry wood, not at all what I expected. First sips are great! The mix of bourbon barrels is very complex. You don’t get any one distinct flavor, but rather a changing swirl of sweetnesses and woods. The vanilla comes in mid-palate with a sort of vanilla bean shell earthiness, a hint of coffee-ness without the coffee. The malts are deep, robust, providing a massive foundation. Some of that cherry comes back toward the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect: Full but crisp and refreshing. Alcohol has that bourbon flavor, but no noticeable bite or warmth at this stage. As it warms, that might change. I can see why people search this out. Excellent brew!Jul 31, 2021"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.52017 vintage courtesy of warmlager from Minnesota 

Look: Black color fairly minimal brown/tan head. Minimum-moderate carbonation. 

Smell: light bourbon, light vanilla, chocolate, wood. 

Taste: vanilla, oak, chocolate, molasses, bourbon, maybe very slight oxidation. 

Feel: medium-thin, smooth, very slight bourbon burn. “Booziness” well-hidden. 

Overall: well incorporated vanilla stout with 3+ years on it. I heard the recent vintage was “not the same” so wanted to try one first that had a good reputation. 

It is good? Yes. It is #13 beer in the world? No.

The smell is divine. Dark fruits, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, and now dark fruits.



The taste is bourbon, vanilla, raisin and finishes with char and leather. The 14.6% abv comes through but minimally and warming.



The mouthfeel is velvet. It coats the mouth with low carbonation and a long, slightly dry finish.



Overall, this is excellent. Great flavors that balance well. A slow sipper for sure.May 23, 2021"

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.



This smells very strongly of coconut, with loads of milk and dark chocolate, very slight roast, light bourbon, and lots of creamy vanilla.



This is definitely sweet, but honestly, not as sweet as I expected. This really does meet the hype that it garners - it's exactly what you want out of high quality pastry. The coconut is done so well, it's so bright and vibrant and just plain tasty. There's a little bit of barrel, it helps anchor the beer slightly. The vanilla is also done very well, and it's all just layered on top of a very tasty and creamy base beer.



This is very creamy and rich, with no real booziness to it at all. It's very, very drinkable.



I almost didn't want this one to be good - I don't always like Angry Chair and this is such a hyped beer. Fortunately (unfortunately?) for me, it's honestly awesome. This is the best Angry Chair beer that I've ever had.Jul 20, 2021"

Smells like chocolate with some light bourbon notes. Taste is the best chocolate I’ve ever tasted in a stout. Rich, sweet chocolate balanced perfectly with a slight bourbon taste. Mouthfeel was also perfect just coating the tongue. This beer blew me away! I’ve had the non BA Version years ago and it was very good but this is in a league of its own.

4.61/5  rDev -1.7%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Pours a slight dark gold with a light frost to the transparency. Head is a couple fingers of plush white foam. 



Aroma is a pleasant quick hit of tropical fruits, citrus, and mild resin and grass. It melds together sugary hop notes seamlessly with sticky hops for a dramatic, dynamic, quick-hitting aroma. Light bready malts adorn the back of the aroma profile, but are faint in comparison to the hops. Hops are never loud, instead, they land at a mild volume of ""six"" on a scale of 1-10, ten being the highest. Instead of using volume, hops are overlapped to create complexity. 



Flavor profile is light tropical fruits and citrus at the onset, sharing the spotlight with resiny, grassy, piney, and mild herbal and floral hops, before dipping back into tropical fruits at the finish. Pine notes build in intensity as the beer warms, but it refrains from crossing into overly sticky or heavy. It's never overtly sweet, nor does it carry a bitter bite at the end, as do some west coast IPAs. Instead, the end is marked by a light dryness that marks an end to hops. That dryness is accompanied by bready malts. 



Mouth feel is medium-thick with a consistent, crisp texture driven by a mild effervescence. It's just thick enough to drink more like an experience, and less like a parking lot, tailgating IPA - though I would never turn down a pour / bottle of this in the latter situation. 



Overall, this beer embodies wonderful balance, along with thoughtful nuance, to create a dreamy smooth IPA. Hops are pleasant, plump, and forward, without carrying the pedal-to-the-metal force of some other IPAs. This one is marked and adorned by simplicity and nuance.

look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 | overall: 3On draft on March 25th and bottle today. In the past four trips up over a decade, Pliny would always have an unmistakable distinguished character to it. It was the Cadillac of Russian River. This time I called the server over. ""Are you sure this is it? Not Happy Hops or something else?"". Nope. This was Younger. More acidic and lacking the smooth richness and piney, sticky aftertaste, and gone was the once amazing nose of sap and sweet burnt sugar. With three to try on this visit, I had just one pour, and was, like my friend, stumped and disappointed. The vibe of visiting Windsor was pleasant, I took a self guided tour, the wait in the spring sunshine a mere three and a half hours, and the food there scrumptious. My friend and I shared a bottle of Refraction, a collab with Brooklyn Brewery, and that seemed to have more to offer. Still, I purchased two bottles of PtY to go to give it another shot at home. Pouring it now in a four ounce glass akin to what they served it in at Santa Rosa, I have the same vibes from it. I got a four pack of R&D #4 from the gift shop and enjoyed those more.

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Appearance - The beer poured a clear golden color with visible carbonation and a white head.



Smell - The earthy pine notes were strong in the nose. By way of comparison, it smelled like in the amped up version of Elder. 



Taste - Having sampled Pliny the elder first, I will use it as a means of comparison. Younger seemed like an amped up version of Elder. The green grass and hops was next level. The pine notes left a little room for sweetness, but there was somewhat of a backbone. The pain notes lingered in the finish. 



Mouthfeel - The beer had the body of an imperial, with carbonation scrubbing away the sweetness and allowing the bitterness to linger.



Overall - Hype-worthy. Glad I got to try some, thanks @bret27Apr 04, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 | overall: 5Welp, it’s been about 18 years or so on the hunt for this elusive brew. Ever since finding craft beer through Sam Adams in the early college days of the mid-2000s, this has been the ultimate Sasquatch beer. Spent most of my years on the east coast and college in Arizona but never took the trip to Northern California. Then finally, living in San Diego, they decide to send more kegs for 2022. Incredible find through a random Google search. Turns out the owner of Fathom Bistro & Bar knows Vinnie. I figured it would be similar to the best beers from HF/TH/Trillium but it’s so different. It’s the perfect West Coast hoppy beer but amplified. Super resinous, dry, and dank. Amazing finish. Feel and body are so smooth. Flavor is obviously off the charts.

Review 1200!!! For this landmark review, I'm tackling the highest rated Traditional Lambic on BA, which also happens to be the 10th highest rated beer overall on the site. This one has been a huge want for me for quite some time now, so I'm happy I managed to source a bottle. I will drink half of this immediately and decant the other half for about 20 minutes, as suggest by 3F and others who have reviewed to see the difference. I will take the highest of the 2 for the official rating, but I'm sure that will be the decanted version. Let's pop it open



Pours a cloudy deep orange with just a thin ring of bubbles which obviously leaves no lacing. Expected for the style, and I don't think decanting will make a difference in this regard



The first whiff of this tells me that decanting is probably the move, as it feels like it needs to open up a bit first. Pre-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of peat smoke, leather, oxidized sherry, wet hay, and white wine vinegar. Post-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, tart peach, white peppercorn, oxidized sherry, wet hay, wheat cracker, toasted oak, light smoke, and stone



The same applies for taste, this is super funky and almost aggressive pre-decant. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, olorosso sherry, sharp oak, leather, sweet honey and light smoke. The swallow brings notes of peat smoke, wet hay, old leather, vinegar, sharp oak, lemon zest, and apple skin. Post-decant, it really opens up. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, pear skin, oxidized sherry, toasted oak, earthy wheat, wet hay, and a touch of peat smoke. The swallow brings notes of oxidized sherry, peat smoke, wet hay, lemon zest, tart peach, wheat bread, stone, light leather and sharp oak



Much like the appearance, I don't think decanting will have any effect on the mouthfeel. A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp and funky beer. Finishes bone dry with a hefty funk. This is so damn refreshing that I could literally chug it, but obviously I wouldn't do that



Wow, this is truly awesome stuff. I mean, I can't say I'm surprised, I knew what I was getting into, but it was an absolute honor. Paired wonderfully with a smoked bleu cheese and fig pecan crackers. I couldn't think of a better beer for 1200. Cheers BA!Jul 24, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass.



Pours a beautiful gold color with a light haziness to the transparency. Head is two fingers of white foam. Aroma is sherry and barrel right off the cusp. Funky stone, lemon, and earthy notes round it out with a light funky nose. Sherry smooths things out, elevating the whole nose from base, while delivering stronger, more potent notes of dried fruit. Flavor profile builds on the nose, hitting sherry and barrel character first. Stone, lemon, tangy green apple, and earthy notes round it out - again. There is a sublime twist of funky tartness that does well to give the whole flavor profile an additional dimension. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. Texture is driven by a consistent, smooth, even texture. Overall, just a splendid beer, in each terms of complexity, quaffability, and thoughtfulness. Lovely.



Blend no 94. Season 18|19. Bottling date of 25/07/19. Served from a 750mL bottle. Decanted. Reviewed from notes. My first pour of a Zenne y Frontera.May 01, 2022"

look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4Canned on 8/9/22; consumed on 9/9/22



Pours an opaque, rusted dark orange body capped with two fingers of creamy, off-white foam; decent head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, moderate, frothy collar, amd layers of chunky, webby lacing encircling the walls of the glass.



Aromas of fresh orange juice sit atop a fluffy malt foundation, soon welcoming peach, passionfruit, and grapefruit peel as undertones of catty dank poke through over time and musty lime eases through the closing impressions.



Taste offers candied grapefruit and sugar-dusted orange as a passionfruit zest meets musty lime to balance a level, tropical citrus overlay, while subtler undertones of fresh peach/mango linger on the finish.



Mouthfeel brings a medium-full body and moderate carbonation, dispersing a weighty fluff of glossy resins through the mid-palate; a creamy counterbalance to a largely subdued grit on the back end eases to a soft hop twang and minimal perceptible bitterness through the finish.



Sweet fruit saturation sports detailed edges of earthier dank, and while heavy on the palate, maintains a steady, balanced presentation of ripe, juicy resins throughout.Sep 09, 2022"

Aroma is big fruit smoothie goodness, its soft tangerine, mango, sweet nectars, honey dew, malts may be showing honey sweetness too. Just a tingle of hoppy bitterness under all the fruity notes.



Taste on this defiantly follows the nose unlike its small brother Julius big fruity notes on a chewy smoothie base. loads of fruity goodness that was in the nose tangerine, nectars, pineapple, mango all mingled in honey dew sweet malts. finish is light lingering bitterness a orange peel rind with touches of herbal notes to finish it out. Very enjoyable IPA good and fruity along with a decent amount of bitterness to keep me happy.



Mouthfeel is a big medium with smooth mellow carbonation that makes it seem even more like a smoothie.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75With utmost radiance, vibrancy and brilliance in its hop display, Tree House's Imperial New England IPA hits hops pinnacle. In a world of princes, they are the king.



And the excellence in King Julius is not only expected but also realized with a creamy peachy-taupe and golden hue with airy textures in its creamy meringue-like froth. The beer's muddled appearance only works to make the session more appetizing. A slow separation of froth ale underneath suggests a viscous character that carries over to a creamy, tangy-sweet and fruit-filled taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and sprucy scent starts out like a fruitier citronella.



The flavors that simply blossom on the middle palate are abundant with a bursting fruit display. Branch-ripe tangerine,in all its tangy, fructose-sweet and vibrant glory springs to life with a zesty support of grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple, pawpaw and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting finish, a sense of herbal sherbet with citronella apply their final and lasting impressions of spiked fruit punch.



Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts plush on the palate but trails into a semi-dry, smoothly bittered, softly resinous and tea-like finish. The soft sappiness of fresh and perfumy cedar links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative minty cooling and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns with gin-spiked sorbet textures as well as flavors.Sep 15, 2022"

An inch of just off-white head on top which hangs around a good bit, and laces the glass well. Nose is as advertised, orange cream, mango, honeydew melon, ripe and sweet and a bit floral at the end. There are so many good NEIPAs out there that I often think they start to run together... then I taste something like this. Sweet at the very beginning, but also floral, big citrus notes, grapefruit and orange peel, with a silky feel. What's incredible is how clean it finishes for what really starts out pretty sweet, but the grassy and a little bitter orange hop resin at the end leave your mouth not overly sweet at the end. The booze is present, but it plays in the background. The bitterness shines through especially at the end in a really satisfying ""take another sip"" type of way.Aug 28, 2022"

""The Crimson King's balcony beer"", indeed.



Wow. It really is cranked up about as high as could be in terms of orangey lupuline saturation. Drinks like Orange Crush toilet wine made in a Scandinavian white-collar prison in heaven. That or an Orange Julius from hell. Either way, only the best. 



Big and rich and fruity and creamy and boozy. It is big enough to require easing into while never approaching harshness or anything off-putting in the flavor. Lovely look to it. Aroma and flavor are an at once complicated and simple blend of tangerine, clementine, apricots, grapefruit rind dipped in honey, pithy citrus oil, weed that has been rehydrated using orange peel, I could go on. Again, wow.... 



Like with most of the IIPAs from TH, this is as close to perfect as you can get. A balance of all the individual components of the style each unique, each cranked to 11 but each in total harmony with the others. Textbook example of what the style can be.



One other thing I want to add here for no real reason. I am far from a TH expert but I have a decently experienced palate and have had a few dozen of their beers over the years. These are the first of their beers I've had in a couple years cause of the pandemic and damned if their packaging has not gotten even more incredible (at least compared to the best packaging you find in Quebec). A month old and just mellowed right into itself. No vague hints of oxidation, no fading or changing profile over the few cans I've had of this (and others ranging up to a month and a half old). Anyway, cheers to the canning line. Based on their many date code messages I've seen over the years and including this one I think we'd all enjoy sitting around listening to music together. You guys rock!



Cheers, KC!

Tangy, orangey smell

Pours a hazy marmalade orange color with a white filmy head

Nice juicy, citrusy taste

But really too astringent with a weird astringent aftertaste

Where is the malt? Very little hop bitterness.

There are lots better IPA’s but the popularity of TreeHouse in a big state like Massachusetts pumps up these scoresAug 21, 2022"

After years and years of dreaming of experiencing Tree House’s offerings, a buddy of mine was kind enough to bring me home a care package on the way home from his vacation. The King is my first choice to sample.



This is a beautiful beer. It pours a thick, creamy, deep orange with a billowy white head. Smells of juicy mango and bright citrus fruits. 



My first mouthful is a melange of orange, mango and tropical fruits. Even better than the taste is the thick and chewy mouthfeel. It almost drinks like a stout! 



This is a fantastic beer that lives up to the hype.Jul 31, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.75Poured from a 16oz can into pint glass in May 2022. There was a canned date of 05/19/22 @ 06:15:46 on the bottom of the can. I bought this at the brewery, and drank less than 1 week from purchase.



Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.



Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.



Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.



Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.



This is an excellent New England IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. I like the overall balance, and would buy this again.May 22, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.52021 vintage, growler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck



Serious question, does Half Time ever disappoint? Any time I’m heading to New York I make a point to stop in there, and I always find good stuff that I can’t really find elsewhere. In addition to 2015 vintage 120 Minute IPA, they had this for fills. A successful trip there yet again. I’ve wanted to try this one for a while, currently sitting at #7 of the highest rated beers of all time on BA. I’m very excited to try this, so let’s crack it open



Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing



It’s not even a question that this is loaded with maple in the nose, but it feels very authentic. I’m picking up on aromas of maple candy, medium roast coffee, sweet caramel, nougat, milk chocolate, raisin, and vanilla creme



In taste, it has an interesting vibe where it’s even more sweet, but also quite balanced in its sweetness. More or less sweetness from different notes working together well. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, marshmallow, sticky maple, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple candy, sticky caramel, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, toffee, and candied raisin



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a super slick beer. Finishes very sticky with a bit of boozy heat



This is good no doubt, great even, but it is very sweet. Because of this, I can’t give it reslly anywhere near the average. A good beer, but there’s better options for this kind of thingNov 06, 2021"

A NEW BAR HAS BEEN SET. 



I’m not sure how this is so perfect. Warm without being boozy, sweet but balanced beauty. With all the extras, the backbone is a well developed stout. This is a magic experience. 



I am blown away that anyone could complain about the $15 pour. Most of NYC just had a mediocre pinot noir for $15 and found that normal. This may be the very best pour value in the city. Go in before it’s gone.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Batch 2, 2022



Oh man, here we are. The highest rated beer from Alaska, and 8th highest rated overall on BA. Getting Anchorage beers is always a treat, but I’m expecting this one to go beyond a treat. Let’s pop this bad boy open



Pours a very dark muddy brown with a finger of reddish dark brown head that immediately fades to nothing and leaves no lacing but decent sheeting



To call the nose decadent would be a massive understatement, I could smell this one from the second I cracked it and the aroma filled the room. I’m picking up on aromas of sticky caramel, thick fudge, toasted coconut, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, dates, light roast coffee, nougat, and a touch of maple



While it is certainly good in taste, it doesn't quite reach the levels of the aroma, though there's still a lot going on. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting chocolate cake, black cherry, sweet coconut, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, and a touch of fudge. The swallow brings notes of chocolate cake, toasted coconut, creamy vanilla, sweet bourbon, fresh oak, fruity coffee, dates, and burnt caramel



A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a rich and slick beer. Finishes slightly sticky with a touch of boozy heat but nothing overbearing



This is truly an awesome beer. I'm sure many will complain that batch 1 was better or some stupid shit like that, but having had only this one, it's amazing. What a treat, cheers BA!May 30, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Poured at fridge temp. Pours jet black with insanely dark brown head. The head disappeared within seconds, leaving an array of very small coconut chunks floating on top. Looks fantastic. 



The nose is absolutely insane. Thick layers of vanilla, coconut, bourbon, chocolate, toffee, marshmallow, a touch of maple, figs, and more sweet fudge. This is definitely on the sweet side, but it just smells thick and creamy. 



The taste is marvelous. In addition to the vanilla, fudge, coconut, and bourbon, some of the roasted malts from the base stouts comes through. Marshmallow and some dark fruit. The coconut is definitely on the toasted side, at least that is what comes through. Some burnt toffee, a touch of coffee grounds, and some oak bitterness on the back end. Overall, this hits all the senses and makes for a great ride. Not overly sweet on the taste. 



Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Long aftertaste. Overall, a fantastic BA stout.May 29, 2022"

4.19/5  rDev -11.6%
look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4Dark, inky body, opaque; carbonation burbles percolate above a flat crown with no head. Very rich, powerful aroma; fudge and milk chocolate; roasted and charred grain; moderate sweetness. Very sweet and spicy taste; cocoa and milk chocolate; vanilla and cinnamon; coconut; raisins and figs; fairly bold alcohol presence simmering beneath the sweetness. Heavy body; slick and chewy; very rich residual sugar feel; some alcohol warmth noted, increasing as the beer warms.



This beer exudes decadence and richness. The overall sweetness is a bit overpowering. I think the alcohol notes are more from the beer's ABV rather than anything from the barrel aging. The lack of any head is also a minus. Still, taste-wise, and overlooking the dominating sweetness, this isn't a bad imperial stout, just lacking some depth and complexity that it really could have it had a bit more balance between the malts, coconut, vanilla, and barrel-aging used in its creation.



Pouring temperature: 41 °F; bottling data: unknown bottling date or version; ABV listed as 15.5%May 10, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 | overall: 3.75I've been waiting over 10 years to try this, and while I never went too far out of my way to try and acquire it, recently a 3-day weekend vacation in Vermont finally provided me with a case of pints from a quiet local liquor store in the middle of nowhere.



And maybe this is 10 years of anticipation talking, but: eh. Well, no, it's not ""eh,"" it's incredibly well made for the style, but I'm a ""juicy"" NEIPA guy, the piney intensity of most DIPAs usually turn me off and it does here as well. The look is a typically nice yellow haze, and the smell is the best thing about the beer -- full of different aromas with pine leading the charge, followed by lemon rind and white pepper.



In my opinion don't listen to the can, pour it in a glass as the complex and powerful aroma is the best thing going here and needs to be experienced.



Now we get to the less favorable parts, which is the mouthfeel and aftertaste. Powerful, mouth coating pine, which is what some people look for but not me. But the worst part is the intense carbonation and gassiness. I'm burping after two sips and bloated by the time the can is done.



To close out on a good note, it has one of the top-5 labels in beer.Oct 07, 2022"

L: Normally kept in the can, this one pours a hazy dark orange with a big head that quickly thins to a film with splotches on the cap and a thicker ring around the glass. Lacing is minimal but attractive.



S: Huge aromas of everything good. Floral, citrus, tropical, mixed berries, and pine. Incredible.



T: Strong hop character in your face up front. Mellows a bit in the middle to reveal some delicious juicy fruit and berries, but the hops never take a back seat. Finishes dry, but not as bitter as the hop punch would suggest.



F: The hop onslaught provides a sticky, resinous mouthfeel, which is not a criticism.



O: Heady Topper takes no prisoners. An absolute hop smackdown that also showcases a wide variety of aromas and flavors. This is the DIPA for those who think west coasts are too bitter and hazies are too juicy.Aug 28, 2022"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75I opened a pint can, bright citrus (mostly pineapple), pine and herbal hops greeted the nose. Bready malt and citrus juice give the impression of sweetness, alcohol is noticeable. I drank out of the can for a few sips, bitter, semi-dry and boldly flavored. Hops are way out in front, juiciness masks the malt flavor. Bitterness rises throughout the taste.



Next, I poured most of the rest into a mug. Pale orange-straw body, very hazy with a rich creamy white head that quickly shrunk to a cap that lasted leaving rings of lacing. The taste is best this way and represents a well-made Imperial New England style IPA. 



Next, I added in the dregs, and I can see why this is not recommended. The haze changed to cloudy and turbid, the taste changed to peppery bitter with a slight funky juiciness. I don't mind the dregs; the white pepper bitterness hides the alcohol and keeps the sweet juice taste in check.



Medium bodied with plentiful carbonation, bold, bitter and still balanced but I wouldn't call it smooth. Lightly colored for the style and begs the question ""Should there be an Imperial NEIPA category?"" 

Following of the pouring guidelines is highly recommended.

It’s been around for years, yet with all the new brews coming and going, it has rarely met it’s match.Aug 12, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4I’m not understanding the hype around this one. My buddy from MA sent me a four pack for my birthday so I have been dissecting this for a week now. 



Pours a wonderful, slightly hazy dark straw color with an immaculate head. 



Aroma seems a bit lacking. Sure it has hops but it isn’t overwhelming or any better than the other 100 IPAs out there. Kind of citrusy with a touch of pine. 



It’s a little malty for my liking. Thick and heavy. The hop oils really coat the tongue. Bitterness is average, not too much. 



It’s a good beer but not world class IMO.Aug 01, 2022"

4.84/5  rDev +2.8%
look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Look: Yeah, I know, I poured it out into a glass – old habits die hard. Light orange and cloudy with a silky-looking pure white head that builds up and holds as a lid, ever-so-slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind

Aroma: Ripe peaches, mango, tangerines, strawberries, cantaloupe melon, pine, some kiwi, kumquats, Cannabis, blueberries, and some sweet malt

Taste: Opens up with a barrage of citrus fruits and resinous pine sap that seemingly gain strength as they develop. Peaches, mango, and mixed berries pop up both together and separate as the journey continues and dankness also makes it presence known here and there in no-so-subtle ways. Malt sweetness tries to keep up but is continually beaten back by the hops and closes with a conifer-laden finish and a delectable, strong bite

Mouthfeel: Full, a little slick, medium-high carbonation, and felt and I’d say medium-strength dryness on the finish

Overall: Wow, this is outstanding. To me, this was the OG I heard about, here on BA, before the NE-Style IPA trend migrated West and when I saw a month-old can, I had to try it as I haven’t been a fan of the sub-style much since it took over here but figured and wished I would be. Happy to say, this is my type of beer though as it absolutely captures the amazing aromatics that the late/dry hop additions and yeast can being to the ‘hazy’ style but it drinks like a WCIPA without the chewy feel and an awesome, pithy bite, and plenty of dryness. Color me WAY impressed and I’d buy this again and again in a heartbeat. Thank you, The Alchemist, for creating this gem and props on blowing me away right out of the gate, as that doesn’t happen oftenJul 14, 2022"

4.24/5  rDev -10%
look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.2516oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $5.25. No canned on date. This must be fresh because this doesn't get distributed here very often and it usually sells out pretty quickly.



Look: Pours a mildly to moderately hazy pale yellow/golden color. The head dissipated quickly. This is very pale for an 8% ABV Double IPA.



Smell: The aroma is very expressive. Tons of dank, resinous hops. A bit of citrus thrown in too. Up front, I get a strong green bell pepper note. This yields to citrusy notes and resinous, piney hoppiness. I get notes of grapefruit and lemon hard candy, along with secondary notes of papaya and mango.



Taste: This is really good. It is actually quite drinkable given how aggressive it is. Up front, it's citrusy and dank. The finish is tooth-enamel stripping bitterness, in a good way. It has a strong bitter finish with lots of woody pine tar, grapefruit pith, and lemon rind. The finish is very dry and the bitterness lingers long.



Feel: It has a slick and oily mouthfeel with a relatively soft carbonation. Medium bodied.



Overall: This is my first time trying Heady Topper, as well as my first time trying anything from Alchemist. There is so much hype around this beer, so it was almost impossible to live up to it. But it actually manages to come pretty close. What I find most interesting about this beer is that it is so different from ""New England-Style IPAs"" that are made by 90% of breweries today. To me, this beer is more West Coast at heart than it is an NEIPA. This beer reminds me of Lagunitas Super Cluster, which I know is all-Citra hopped and I do not know which hops are used in Heady Topper. I would think that there at least has got to be Citra in here too though. Also reminds me a bit of Foley Brothers Prospect.Jul 12, 2022"

look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 | overall: 3.5Very difficult beer to find in my area. Luckily, there was what appears to be a one time drop at my local store - very limited amount. I scoffed two 4 packs. This is definitely a solid brew, but I don't find it all that drinkable. I was never able to drink more than one before wanting to move on to something else. Pretty one-dimensional to me - bitter, bitter, and bitter. I prefer a more balanced, multifaceted IPA. 



If I come across some I will probably purchase a 4 pack, but it's not something I will be actively seeking out, there are plenty of other beers that I prefer over this one.Jun 15, 2022"

It does look pretty good, has a very piney smell that just doesn't resonate with me, and the taste is full of that same resin that comes from pine. I suppose there are many that swear by it, but this just isn't what I was expecting from a ""world class"" beer. Mouthfeel was smooth, I do have to give it that, actually very smooth.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 | overall: 4.25This is a beer I've been wanting to try for some time now (was able to obtain it in a trade for Fremont B5K).



The beer pours fairly dark, blackish brown color with good head retention and considerable lacing. The beer certainly looks impressive enough. On the nose, I pick up vanilla, green chili peppers, some chocolate, underlying coffee and considerable whiskey. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though I thought it a bit hot on the finish (something that is especially noticeable, given the chili flavor in this beer). That being said, the barrel aging seems to mute the base beer flavors in this beer somewhat, and really doesn't seem to blend in all that well. It does add another flavor component/dimension, which is always nice, but the whiskey flavor otherwise doesn't seem to bring a lot to the party in this beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full otherwise, and the alcohol seemed to be pretty well integrated into the flavor profile. Drinkability is pretty good, though it's hard to imagine drinking more than a small amount of this beer at a sitting.



This is a very nice beer, but given it's reputation, I confess I was expecting a bit more from it. Very glad I had the opportunity to try it, but this probably isn't a beer I'd want to seek out again.Mar 18, 2022"

The taste of the beer has the cinnamon and the touch of spice in there along with the vanilla and chocolate. The feel is nice and silky, doesn't burn the throat or mouth from the adjuncts which is perfect. Overall it's an outstanding beer and was fortunate to try it finally.Sep 20, 2021"

look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Big time grail for me. Vintage 2019 on tap at Bier Station, consumed and reviewed October 2021.



Pours black with a finger and a half of dark caramel foam. Good head retention. Aroma is spices, cinnamon, chocolate, toffee, caramel, and molasses. Roasty and toasty malts offer up a firm base, adding a strong malty stout backbone to each whiff. As the sweetness crescendos to a peak, barrel character sweeps in to add some char, bourbon, and bitterness. Alcohol remains an after thought, allowing the beer to shine forward of its ABV. Loaded from first whiff to last sniff. Flavor profile is more of the same - a firm stout base of roasty and toasty malts form the foundation of cinnamon, spices, vanilla, caramel, molasses, toffee, and cream. It opens up less spicy than the nose, but finishes more spicy than the nose, that is to say, the dynamics are shaped in contrast - mirrored. Only caveat to the mirror image is the barrel character notes of char and bourbon that come thru at the end again, dropping this stout an octave into deeper heartiness. Despite the bourbon character popping through the beer, the beer never comes off as hot. Mouth feel is thick with a smooth, consistent grit. Its feel is uniform from front to back. Overall, incredible depth with loads of barrel complimenting the initial spices well. It borders on an ADHD stout, spreading it's attention in a spiderweb of directions, but remains cohesive enough to form an intoxicating melody.

Chocolate, vanilla and plum stand out most in the nose. I really enjoy the fruitiness behind what is some very strong brownie batter and vanilla.



The taste is pretty similar. Loads of vanilla without it seeming artificial. High quality brownie. Fruit complexity underneath. And lots of heat.



Oily slick feel with soft fizz.



Probably overhyped, but still very nicely done. The flavors are all intense without being over intense.Jun 25, 2022"

look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.75Just because it can't be perfect, I guess, but it's damn close.



L:I was looking for Marshmallow Handjee. Looked for awhile. Looks cool in the bottle and better in my wine glass.

S: Mmmmm - did I see it can't be perfect? The nose on this gem is as close as it gets. Before the characteristic Dark Lord depth, there is the vanilla-creamy-sweet-smores thing going. And that's just the easy part. The complex, fine barrel notes compete with the earthy black malts and I love every moment of the struggle. If oil came from barley, this would fuel jets.

T: No surprises because the smell telegraphs the taste like an amateur against Ali. More of the vanilla sweet cocoa gram up front followed by the bourbon twisted chocolate caramel espresso of a great stout. It's all here.

F: It's like chewing bubble gum that never gets boring nor loses its flavor. Heavy like the punch that aforementioned amateur caught on the jaw though. Sloooww sipper.

Overall this is how it's done. An adjunct stout is never my first choice but, when done right, you get something like this. I don't like it better than the straight up WWS or some of the other simple, three ingredient brews, but it is damn good.May 07, 2022"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 | overall: 4.5Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Heavy oily legs form on the glass after a swirl. Aroma is marshmallow and brown sugary initially. This overt sugariness breaks away to reveal roasty and toasty malts with a hearty bitter edge. Underneath is bourbon and late barrel character, which further counteract the initial sugary notes. Flavor profile pushes the same start - marshmallow and brown sugar, in addition to toffee. As these start-up notes fade, hearty barrel, bourbon, and roasty and toasty malts are revealed. The latter hearty notes becomes the storyline the second half, countering the initial sugary notes well. Mouth feel is thick, with a velvety, smooth, and full texture. Overall, while the sugary start leads to a dangerous territory, the following malt and barrel notes balance the whole experience out well. 



Served from a 750mL bottle. Light blue wax. Allowed to warm ~45 minutes at room temperature after removal from the fridge. Reviewed from notes.Apr 13, 2022"

Remarkable how little this tastes like a regular Darklord. It's fairly sweet which i generally don't like, but the barrel presence compensates enough to make it really enjoyable. It delivers on all fronts with ton's of vanilla, chocolate notes and some heat from the barrel. It's also nice and thiccc.Feb 17, 2022"

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5Brewing pastry stouts before pastry stouts were cool, the imperial stout that Dark Lord used to be has trended sweeter, more sultry, heavier and stronger as time has passes. Now doubling down with a vanilla-riddled, bourbon barrel aged version of that notorious elixir has allowed time to finally catch up with it.



With a thick, oily and onyx looking pour, Marshmallow Hanjee shares barely a trickle of froth before falling still. As its decadent scent of vanilla drifts gently above its sweet and savory roast, the scent of espresso, cocoa and nuttiness permeates an oxidized aroma of sherry, port and soy. Devilishly sweet, the beer's early cloying nature saturates the early palate with molasses, sorghum, vanilla cream and all-things burnt marshmallows.



As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a full and lavish saturation of the tastebuds reveal bold complementary flavors of espresso, bittersweet chocolate, white chocolate, sweet wines and savory sherry, port and madeira. Hinting toward soy sauce, a late and whisky soaked taste of bourbon keeps the complex flavors of coconut, caramel, toasted oak and bourbon spice coming sip after sip.



Heavy, rich and undeniably cloying, the sipping ale is oily and warm on the palate, reserved as an after dinner digestif. A long, rich and fat maltiness clings to the mouth for an impossibly long and spicy aftertaste.Dec 27, 2021"

look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.75Unofficially my last beer of the top 250 (had the trade secured for it before changes were made to calculations, making me 20 short again...)



It glugs out of the bottle super thick and tar black. It has a finger and a half head of tight, thick khaki bubbles that recedes slowly to a thin film and collar that retain throughout. Leaves some nice legs on the glass when swirled.



Immediate strong aromas of boozy bourbon are softened by sweet vanilla and lightly toasted marshmallow. Fudgey brownie batter, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toasted coconut, and charred oak all follow. There's just a hint of figs linger in the background.



The flavor is quite bourbon forward, but very round and smooth. It's like a scoop of real vanilla bean ice cream topped with burnt caramel, artisan fudge, and a shot of high end bourbon. Nothing pops much except maybe the bourbon, but this is quite well balanced.



The mouth feel is thick, but not overly so. It's slick and coats the mouth well, lingering and begging you to take another sip. Just the right amount (only a touch) of carbonation, and a bone dry, slightly boozy finish. Superb!



Overall this is an absolute pleasure of a beer to drink, and a worthy one for my ""last"" of the 250 list! It doesn't blow me away in the flavor department, but it does in its balance and roundedness! Those are things hard to find in modern BA adjunct stouts! The fact that I could EASILY solo dome this bottle says something!Jan 14, 2022"

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 | overall: 3.75So I just read a review that called the legendary KBBS, “typical…white trash.” It kinda made me nervous because I don’t dig white/pale stouts and I thought, “how could I miss that this being a white stout?!”

Well happily that guy is drinking something else. Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares?

So KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too. 

The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care. 

After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful. 

Given the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant. 

Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one…Mar 11, 2022"

Holy. Fucking. Shit. KBBS. Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh?



Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacing



The nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbon



Man, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. Sublime



A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetness



I won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one. More than the sum of its parts. Cheers BA!Feb 26, 2022"

The feel department is where this stout lacks. Feels very light, which is good for me as someone not too fond of stouts and lagers but to the avid fan of a heavier beer, this one may disappoint.

look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 | overall: 4.25A: Nightfall in appearance that presents a class, of shades, within the Bearded Iris: Before the Storm. Though, the arriving predominance peers to schemes of an Ayam Cemani, with dyed allocations on provoked (methodical) discharges. Inasmuch as, light charcoal to the late reposed tones of a Cayuga Duck, given the dark purple to aerated grey-green exhales. In conjunction, a fallow headpiece that’s brief in withstanding preservation. Yet, justifiably well-designed, as the accents address the Beaver toned collapse with a Dutch white lip. There is minimal adherence upon the necks fold, as that portrayal comes in balmy, goaded strides. Notwithstanding, the thermal development behind tack-distilled tears, for adequately webbing church windows. To that extent, a multi-layered scene that’s deep for optimization with each intermission 



S: Malt is put into motion and characterized by the sweet/rich lexicons with a thick trek for pure maple, as a slight roasted bite aids in dimension. Thereby, ushering in dark chocolate on sticky toffee, while puck tamping a quad-sized shot in back. There’s a pastiness in the peripheral that fastens the bourbon adhesion to coffee beans. Coupled with, an aerated basecoat for raisin molasses gems, while strolling cold deciduous forests, as red maple and birch bark circumference pine resin. The barrel interiors coat figs and prunes beneath, while malt soothes midriffs above, before synergizing cask complexions. Accordingly, a caramel crème brûlée middle with a touch of frangipane/hazelnut praline, while the blend puts notice on vanilla oak staves. The furtherance becomes rightly victimized, by the prolonged exposure, where opportunities pit meaty leather to spice-pipe tobacco, as marshmallow fondant faints to the barreled derived coconut. This progresses to sawn wood, from the recoiled temperate woodlands, as a balminess curbs brandy to the dried fruit shifts and hard Chimes. In the interim, an oak sediment lingers with a dry hop bite amongst ricocheting malt, as bourbon pitches flat densities to the rhythm behind (soft) tannins



T: A proactive start on clean maple that measures a light bourbon dictation against roasted grains, as esters serenely interweave. The blend fondues oak atop Barhi Dates and Pain aux raisins, while summersaulting around prunes, before paying heed to Lemberger grapes. That aside, foretaste is mainly situated on rich Ganache over maple poffertjes, as a robust earthiness tends juneberries to dark rosin cascades. Mid-palate opens malt to bready dexterities with reacting nuts/walnuts, in the act of a polymer coalescence. Chiefly, a league for barrel mechanics besides toasted grains, as the equidistant hovers around caramelized toffee and chocolate cordials. In a prolonged/timely struggle, the progression veers off of fudge fondant for more complex - wooded - polymers set to vanillin staves, and oaked-smoked book shelves. Moreover, a greenhouse effect that becomes prevalent in the orchestration of deferred intervals. In light of oxygenating restfully across the hours, the blend incriminates Bual, from Madeira regions, and suggests charred figs with dried marzipan. In turn, a distantly placed roasted bite to the inclining warming degree, as the blend’s anatomy codas tarry skins with Mozhee extractions



M: A level of fatness that’s rich in fluidity, for levying a smooth, composited viscosity. The mechanics attend carbonation cautiously, by truncating the spectrum, for warming coordination behind that semi-tamed glueyness. Such factors roadmap a weighing scale, as vitrics breath open air, and course a drying constitute. In passing, the approach offers an adhesiveness without taxing saccharinity, while protracting an earthly bite to waddle an exsiccation with light (caustic) tannin physiques



O: The framework provides a eurythmic nature on maple, with a backing around barrel warmth and an elusive sense to earthy livelihoods. In centering agenda, the woody hop influence remains docile to the gravity behind malts blended depth, yet prompts in for balance and refines ester institution on clocked time. Consequently, forest fruits and backwoods are shrouded, by a tug-of-war sense of heft, but consciously linger with a palate fondness in stepJan 01, 2022"

Its delicious as far as maple syrup goes, but overall it was lacking in complexity. Barrel was light and not much else. Nice mouth feel and long finish.Aug 12, 2021"
